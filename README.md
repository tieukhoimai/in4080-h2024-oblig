# IN4080 – Natural Language Processing

This repository contains my mandatory assignments for the course IN4080 – Natural Language Processing at the University of Oslo in the Fall 2024.

## Obligatory Assignment 1

The first assignment focuses on the basics of natural language processing and consists of three tasks:

1. **Byte-Pair-Encoding (BPE) Tokenizer**: Test and improve a BPE tokenizer.
2. **N-gram Language Model**: Estimate an N-gram language model based on a training corpus and the tokenizer from Part 1.
3. **Classification Model**: Develop a basic classification model to distinguish between Bokmål and Nynorsk sentences.


## Obligatory Assignment 2

The second assignment focuses on sequence labeling and consists of three tasks:

1. **Greedy Sequence Labeling Model**: Experiment with a greedy sequence labeling model and investigate the impact of different feature types on part-of-speech tagging performance.
2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Evaluate the best model on a different task, named entity recognition.
3. **Text Classification**: Implement a simple feed-forward neural network for text classification.

## Obligatory Assignment 3
This assignment focuses on the practical use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and consists of:

1. **Basic Response Generator**: Implement methods to generate responses using an instruction-tuned LLM.
2. **Sparse Retrieval**: Implement a BM25 retriever to find relevant documents.
3. **Dense Retrieval**: Re-implement the search method to segment documents into sentences and find the most relevant sentences using sentence embeddings.
4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Implement a system that retrieves relevant sentences and generates responses based on them.


## Obligatory Assignment 4
The fourth assignment focuses on two advanced topics in natural language processing:

1. **Dialogue Systems**: Develop a spoken conversational interface for a simulated elevator.
2. **Machine Translation**: Implement and fine-tune a machine translation model.
