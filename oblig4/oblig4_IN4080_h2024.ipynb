    "# IN4080: obligatory assignment 4\n",
    " \n",
    "The final mandatory assignment for IN4080 consists of two parts. The first is about the development of dialogue systems, and the second about machine translation.\n",
    "You are required to get at least 12/20 points to pass. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We assume that you have read and are familiar with IFIâ€™s requirements and guidelines for mandatory assignments, see [here](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/examinations/compulsory-activities/mn-ifi-mandatory.html) and [here](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/examinations/compulsory-activities/mn-ifi-guidelines.html).\n",
    "- This is an individual assignment. You should not deliver joint submissions. \n",
    "- You may redeliver in Devilry before the deadline (__Sunday, November 3 at 23:59__).\n",
    "- Only the last delivery will be read! If you deliver more than one file, put them into a zip-archive. You don't have to include in your delivery the data files already provided for this assignment. \n",
    "- Name your submission _your\\_username\\_in4080\\_mandatory\\_4_\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1 should be done on your local computer, as it relies on a speech interface that will not work on remote machines. For Part 2, using _Fox_ is preferable, at least for the fine-tuning task.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should deliver a completed version of this Jupyter notebook, containing both your code and explanations about the steps you followed. We want to stress that simply submitting code is __not__ by itself sufficient to complete the assignment - we expect the notebook to also contain explanations of what you have implemented, along with motivations for the choices you made along the way. Preferably use whole sentences, and mathematical formulas if necessary. Explaining in your own words (using concepts we have covered through in the lectures) what you have implemented and reflecting on your solution is an important part of the learning process - take it seriously!\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the use of LLMs (ChatGPT or similar): you are allowed to use them as 'sparring partner', for instance to clarify something you have not understood. However, you are __not__ allowed to use them to generate solutions (either in part or in full) to the assignment tasks. \n"

    "- The elevator should handle misunderstandings and uncertainties, e.g. by requesting the user to repeat, or asking the user to confirm if the intent is uncertain (say, when its confidence score is lower than 0.5). \n",
    "- The elevator should also allow the user to ask where the office of a given employee is located. For instance, the user could ask \"_where is Erik Velldal's office?_\", and the elevator would provide a response such as \"_The office of Erik Velldal is on the 4th floor. Do you wish to go there?_\".  We provide you with the office numbers of a small set of IFI employees in the `OFFICES` dictionary (see below).\n",
    "- The elevator should also be able to inform the user about the current floor (such as replying to \"_Which floor are we on?_\" or \"_Are we on the 5th floor?_\"). \n",
    "- Finally, if the user asks the elevator to stop (or if the user says \"_no_\" after a grounding feedback \"_Ok, going to floor $X$._\"), the elevator should stop, and ask for clarification regarding the actual user intent. \n",
