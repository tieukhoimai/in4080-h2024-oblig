    " \n",
    "Mandatory assignment 1 consists of three parts. In Part 1, you will experiment with a greedy sequence labeling model and investigate the impact of different feature types on **part-of-speech tagging** performance (9 points + 2 optional bonus points). In Part 2, you will evaluate the best model on a different task, **named entity recognition** (5 points). In Part 3, you will return to the **text classification task** and implement a simple feed-forward neural network for it (6 points).\n",
    "\n",
    "You should answer all three parts. You are required to get at least 12/20 points to pass. The most important is that you try to answer each question (possibly with some mistakes), to help you gain a better and more concrete understanding of the topics covered during the lectures. In the first part, there are also bonus questions for those of you who would like to deepen their understanding of the topics covered by this assignment.\n",

We want to stress that simply submitting code is __not__ by itself sufficient to complete the assignment - we expect the notebook to also contain explanations of what you have implemented, along with motivations for the choices you made along the way. Preferably use whole sentences, and mathematical formulas if necessary. Explaining in your own words (using concepts we have covered through in the lectures) what you have done and reflecting on your solution is an important part of the learning process - take it seriously!\n",

    "In the lecture, we have discussed Matthew Honnibal's proposal of a discriminative sequence labelling model with greedy decoding. He argued that an extended set of features is more helpful for tagging than exact (Viterbi) decoding. Therefore, we skip HMMs and the Viterbi algorithm here and focus on models based on logistic regression.\n",
