We want to stress that simply submitting code is __not__ by itself sufficient to complete the assignment - we expect the notebook to also contain explanations of what you have implemented, along with motivations for the choices you made along the way. Preferably use whole sentences, and mathematical formulas if necessary. Explaining in your own words (using concepts we have covered through in the lectures) what you have implemented and reflecting on your solution is an important part of the learning process - take it seriously!\n",

The illegitimate daughter to the famous Echani General Yusanis and Jedi Master Arren Kae, both of whom fought in the Mandalorian Wars, she later served along with her five half-sisters as the Handmaiden Sisters under Jedi Master Atris in the period following the Jedi Civil War. During her service to Atris at the Jedi Academy on Telos IV, Brianna met Meetra Surik, also known as the Jedi Exile, and was subsequently tasked with accompanying her on her mission to seek out the Lost Jedi, Jedi Masters who survived the First Jedi Purge. As Surik\\'s companion, Brianna helped battle against numerous adversaries, including the Sith Triumvirate.\\n\\nDuring the journey, Brianna trained Surik in Echani techniques and eventually received Jedi training from Surik in return, becoming one of the first new members of the Jedi Order after the Purge. In accepting such training, however, she broke her oath to Atris. The Jedi Master labeled her a traitor, resulting in a confrontation between Brianna, her sisters and her former master. According to the predictions of Kreia, Brianna would become instrumental in the reconstruction of the Jedi Order and succeed Atris as its lead Jedi historian.',\n",

She was deeply committed to the Order and was a fierce adherent of the Jedi Code. But Atris' faith in the righteousness of the Jedi wavered when her personal hero, Meetra Surik, turned her back on the Council to join rogue Knights Revan and Malak and their faction of Jedi during the Mandalorian Wars. Atris chose not to go to war, but this decision left her bitter and conflicted.\\n\\nWhen Surik returned to face the Council's judgment after the devastating events of the Battle of Malachor V, Atris was the first to condemn her, suggesting that she had fallen to the dark side just as Revan had. Over time, Atris grew to hate Surik for complicating her black-and-white view of the Jedi, the Sith, and the Force. During the Dark Wars, Atris called a secret Jedi convocation on the Miraluka world of Katarr in an attempt to find the threat that was stalking the Jedi. She then leaked knowledge of the conclave's existence in the hopes of drawing out the Sith. She succeeded, but with dire consequences; Darth Nihilus devastated the surface of the planet, wiping out all life on Katarr, including the Jedi gathered there.\\n\\nHowever, Atris survived, and she remained in seclusion, surrounding herself with Echani Handmaidens who could not feel the Force. She planned to rebuild the Jedi Order, and established a Jedi Academy in the old irrigation system on Telos IV. However, she was heavily influenced by the many Sith holocrons she had collected in her efforts to find and understand the Sith. The holocrons fed her bitterness, and she slowly and quietly fell to the dark side, consequently becoming Darth Traya, the Queen of Betrayal. Per the machinations of her mentor, Kreia, the first Darth Traya, Surik and the new Traya confronted each other once more on Telos, where Surik convinced Atris to turn away from the dark side. Atris then remained in the Jedi Academy, waiting to be judged for her actions by the new Jedi Council.\",\n",

Since then, Disney has split off Star Wars into two main categories, those being Star Wars Legends and Star Wars Canon, with Canon being the \"official\" story of the franchise.\\n\\nThe catalyst of the multimedia franchise was the release of its mainline story, officially known as the Skywalker Saga; a collection of 9 films released from the years 1977 to 2019, with the first and last release of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope and Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, respectively.

       " 'Meetra Surik': \"Meetra Surik, also known as the Jedi Exile after the Mandalorian Wars, was a female Human Jedi Master. As a Padawan, she chose to disobey the orders of the Jedi High Council and aid the Galactic Republic in its war against the invading Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. Rising to the rank of Jedi Knight during the conflict, she served with distinction under the command of her fellow Crusaders Revan and Malak and was eventually commissioned as a General in the Republic Military. Surik played a vital role in defeating the Mandalorians during the latter stages of the conflict, but as a direct result of her controversial actions during the cataclysmic final battle, she effectively cut her connection to the Force. Afterwards, out of all those who went to war, she was the only Jedi to avoid the call of the dark side and return to the Jedi Council to be judged for her crimes. After being exiled from the Jedi Order, she wandered the periphery of known space for nearly a decade before returning to the Republic during the Dark Wars, at the height of the First Jedi Purge.\\n\\nCaught up in the schemes of various mysterious factions, she was swiftly drawn into the ongoing conflict and became instrumental in engineering the defeat of the Sith Triumvirate, ruled by Darth Nihilus, Darth Sion and Darth Traya. With both her connection to the Force and the Jedi Order restored, Surik emerged victorious from her campaign against the Sith Lords, and immediately began a search for the long absent Jedi Revan. She eventually found Revan imprisoned on Dromund Kaas, the capital world of a Sith Empire, believed to have been destroyed over a thousand years prior. Surik joined Revan in his mission to kill the Sith Emperor, who had been plotting an invasion of the Republic for centuries. She, Revan and Lord Scourge joined forces in their common cause and attacked the Emperor. However, Scourge seemingly betrayed his Jedi allies and stabbed Surik from behind, killing her instantly. Her death helped Revan in delaying the Emperor and his plans.\\n\\nSurik did not become one with the Force at the time of her death; instead, her spirit stayed with Revan and helped him to endure the horrors of his imprisonment in stasis. In the following years after her physical demise, the Jedi that she trained during her travels proved essential to the process of rebuilding the Jedi Order, in the wake of its near annihilation due to the machinations of the Sith. When the Sith Emperor finally unleashed his army against the Republic three centuries later, Surik's spirit instructed Jedi Master Oteg to dispatch a team to free Revan from his prison in the Maelstrom Nebula. After urging Revan to fulfill his objective and destroy the Emperor, Surik disappeared. Years later, Surik later joined with the legendary Alliance Commander and many of history's greatest champions to battle the reassembling vestiges of Vitiate's essence, destroying the Emperor once and for all. Surik then became one with the Force.\",\n",

Close friends with fellow filmmakers Steven Spielberg and Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas worked on the Indiana Jones franchise with Spielberg after meeting him through his own directorial debut, THX 1138, and the films The Rain People and Apocalypse Now, directed by Coppola. With the latter\\'s backing, Lucas made American Graffiti, and subsequently relied on its success to create Star Wars. Although it suffered significant setbacks and failed to achieve what Lucas wanted, the film was an immense success. George Lucas thus continued to tell his mythology, producing the third saga film in 1983.\\n\\nHowever, Lucas was then divorced by his wife, Marcia, and was left with a three-year-old daughter. Lucas thus decided to prioritize raising his family, leaving his company, Lucasfilm Ltd., to manage the popular Star Wars franchise. In the 1980s, filming technology developed under Lucasfilm\\'s Industrial Light & Magic division, whose employee John Knoll co-created Photoshop and whose computer division spawned EditDroid and Avid and developed into Pixar. George Lucas also became close acquaintances with mythologist Joseph Campbell, often speaking with his \"Yoda\" at Skywalker Ranch up until Campbell\\'s death. In the 1990s, Lucas resumed active participation in the film industry, working on The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles and joining fellow film directors such as Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood, and Stanley Kubrick alongside Spielberg, and Coppola on the Film Foundation\\'s board of directors. Lucas also founded Edutopia, an education organization, and continued to push the boundaries of filmmaking technology to create the Special Editions. Faced with a decision to either go back to directing films that are more pure cinema and more visually-oriented and possibly never return to Star Wars, or to finish Star Wars by telling the backstory, which was never intended to be done, was not written as a movie, and yet was now a feasible project with new technology. From the late 1990s to 2005, Lucas returned with much of the film crew from The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles to complete the Star Wars saga with the prequel trilogy, where he would be able to tell the story of Darth Vader, as intended at first with the original trilogy, without any frustrations with technology.\\n\\nAfter working on Star Wars: The Clone Wars television series with Dave Filoni, George Lucas desired to return to experimental films, and sold Lucasfilm to The Walt Disney Company in 2012 to prevent risking the company\\'s financial standing and the livelihoods of his employees.

Born on the planet Talravin to Helena Shan and a treasure hunter, her mother gave her up to the Jedi Order, believing that their lifestyle of travel and exertions was not suitable for her daughter. Shan was found to have an exceptional gift with a Force power known as battle meditation; which increased her allies' morale while demoralizing her enemies. Shan sided with the Jedi Council when the Jedi Knights Revan and Malak rebelled against the Council and joined the Galactic Republic in its war against the invading Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders.\\n\\nOne year after the final battle of the Mandalorian Wars, Revan returned from the Unknown Regions as the new Dark Lord of the Sith, with Malak as his apprentice, at the head of a new Sith Empire. Two years into the Jedi Civil War, Shan was the leader of a Jedi strike team sent to capture Darth Revan and Darth Malak. When her team boarded Revan's vessel, they managed to corner the Dark Lord on the bridge. Before they could engage Revan in combat, Malak, who was separated from his Master during the battle, betrayed Revan by ordering the guns of his flagship Leviathan to fire on Revan's vessel in an attempt to destroy both the Jedi and Revan.\\n\\nHowever, Shan survived and managed to use the Force to stabilize Revan, who was near death. This act created a bond between the two and Shan brought the comatose Revan to the Jedi Council. Both the Council and Shan came up with a plan and temporarily erased Revan's memories, reprogramming Revan with an identity of a soldier loyal to the Republic. The Council hoped that Shan, through her bond with Revan, would be able to coerce Revan into revealing the location of the Rakatan space station called the Star Forge, which was now under the new Dark Lord Darth Malak's control.\\n\\nIn the final year of the war, Shan's Republic warship Endar Spire was ambushed and attacked by Malak's fleet above the Outer Rim planet Taris. She managed to flee the ship aboard one of its escape pods, assisted by Republic commander Carth Onasi. Shortly after her pod reached the surface, Shan was captured by a swoop gang known as the Black Vulkars. After Revan and Onasi landed on Taris, they managed to track down and rescue Shan. She, Revan, and their companions teamed up with the Mandalorian Canderous Ordo, managing to steal both the launch codes necessary to escape Taris and the Exchange crime lord Davik Kang's light freighter Ebon Hawk, killing Davik and nearly doing the same to Calo Nord, who Revan, Bastila and one of their companions would later kill on Kashyyyk. Shan and her companions escaped during the Sith's bombardment of Taris, and headed to Dantooine, where a Jedi Enclave was located.\\n\\nAfter Shan met with the Dantooine Jedi Council, they began retraining Revan in the Jedi ways. After finding a Rakatan Star Map in the burial mounds near the Enclave, the Council tasked Shan, Revan, and their companions with finding the Star Forge. During their travels, Shan watched Revan closely to ensure that he did not fall to the dark side. Shan eventually fell in love with Revan, who, despite his past, was able to remain true to the Jedi Code. After Revan found a fourth Star Map—which was necessary to locate the Star Forge—Shan was captured by Malak and fell to the dark side after a week of torture at her new Sith Master's hands.\\n\\nHowever, Revan eventually confronted Shan aboard the Star Forge and she was redeemed from the darkness to which she had succumbed. To prove her reclaimed faith, Shan aided the Republic in the Battle of Rakata Prime through the means of her battle meditation. Revan then vanquished Malak, and the Republic fleet successfully destroyed the Star Forge, routing the Sith forces. Sometime after this, Shan and Revan married, and started a new life together. However, within the next two years, Revan left for the Unknown Regions, seeking to eliminate a hidden Sith threat that Revan had discovered during his time as the Dark Lord.

He survived the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator superweapon during the war's final battle at the planet of Malachor V, which surrounded the planet with a destructive spatial phenomenon known as a mass shadow. Experiencing the shadow that obliterated almost everything on and around the planet made Nihilus crave Force energy. The affliction painfully ravaged his body while rendering him a wound in the Force. He was found by a seeker of these, the former Jedi Kreia, who became the Sith Lord Darth Traya and told him that she could teach him to feed his endless hunger. He accepted her offer of apprenticeship at the Trayus Academy on Malachor V, where he, over time, became one of three concurrent Dark Lords of the Sith.\\n\\nTogether, they formed a triumvirate with Darth Traya at its head and her other apprentice, Darth Sion, as the third member. The trio chose individual titles for themselves, Darth Nihilus becoming the Lord of Hunger. The apprentices grew in strength throughout their training and eventually overpowered their master. Sion defeated Traya, while Nihilus sapped her energy. The two Sith then combined power to sever her connection to the Force and sent her into exile. Nihilus' affliction developed to the point where the Dark Lord was forced to call upon the dark side of the Force to encase his spirit within his mask and armor to stay alive. He and Sion then began a Jedi purge, causing the virtual extinction of the Jedi Order. Nihilus was responsible for the devastation of the planet Katarr in 3952 BBY, killing and absorbing the Force energy of the Jedi at the Conclave on Katarr along with every other living thing on the world save one Miraluka woman named Visas Marr. Marr was collected from the surface and Nihilus began to train her as his Shadow Hand.\\n\\nOne year later, Nihilus sensed a growing presence in the Force and sent Marr out to eliminate it. That presence was a woman exiled from the Jedi Order, Meetra Surik, who was on a quest to find the few Jedi Masters who had survived the Purge with the aide of Darth Traya, who had put away her Sith trappings and identified herself once more as Kreia. When Marr attempted to assassinate Surik, the exiled Jedi defeated her and convinced her to turn to the light side of the Force in the process. Although Nihilus returned to lurking the fringes of known space, he was eventually tricked by Kreia into initiating the Battle of Telos IV in an attempt to absorb a Jedi Academy that lacked any Force-sensitives aside from the headmistress. Nihilus met a large Republic and Mandalorian fleet at Telos IV that distracted him. Meanwhile, his flagship, the Ravager, was secretly boarded by a small force consisting of Surik, Marr, Mandalore the Preserver, and his Mandalorians. The trio confronted and slew Nihilus in the ensuing duel while the Mandalorians rigged explosives that destroyed the ship.

       " 'Freedon Nadd': \"Freedon Nadd was an Old Republic Jedi prodigy whose conscious decision to embrace the dark side of the Force had a significant impact on galactic events for many generations after his death. Nadd's career began as a student in training on the planet Ossus, but a lust for greater power caused him to slay his Master, Matta Tremayne, and renounce his affiliation with the Jedi Order. He fled Ossus and made his way to the heart of the old Sith Empire, where he gained an enormous wealth of dark side knowledge. He eventually followed the Force to the jungle moon of Yavin 4, where he found and apprenticed himself to the ancient Dark Lord Naga Sadow. Sadow trained Nadd in the Sith arts, and led the young Jedi even further down the dark path. When he determined that he had learned all his Sith Master had to offer, Nadd used his newfound powers to kill Sadow and left Yavin 4 behind in search of a world to conquer as his own. He proclaimed himself Dark Lord of the Sith, and used his sorcerous powers to subjugate the world of Onderon, where he ruled as king from the capital of Iziz for more than a hundred years until his physical demise. His body was entombed below the royal palace of Iziz, which became a focal point of Sith power. Nadd's spirit lingered in the tomb, from whence it taught the descendants of his bloodline and further steeped Onderon in the miasma that was the dark side of the Force.\\n\\nBy 4000 BBY, the exaltation of Freedon Nadd's memory was the catalyst for the final battle of the centuries-spanning Beast Wars of Onderon, a conflict that arose between the citizens of Iziz who worshiped the deceased Dark Lord and those who had been cast out for their refusal to pledge allegiance to the Sith. A team of Jedi Knights led by Arkanian Master Arca Jeth came to Onderon, ended the battle, and brought a temporary halt to Nadd's influence over the planet with the defeat of Queen Amanoa. However, Amanoa's husband, King Ommin, reasserted Sith influence over the planet when he summoned Freedon Nadd's spirit from Chaos. The restored Naddist cult then rose up in arms and stole the Dark Lord's sarcophagus in a surprise attack during Amanoa's funeral. Nadd revealed himself to the Jedi and participated in the capture of Arca Jeth, who was ultimately rescued by the Jedi after the defeat of King Ommin during the final stages of the Naddist insurrection. Conceding failure, Nadd abandoned Ommin to the mercy of the Jedi, and his spirit was forever banished from Onderon by the power of Arca Jeth. Prior to his departure, however, Nadd happened upon Tetan socialites Aleema and Satal Keto—who had come to Onderon in search of dark side knowledge—and chose to pass the Sith teachings on to them. While Nadd's tomb was relocated to Onderon's jungle moon by the Jedi, his spirit appeared to one of them, Ulic Qel-Droma, and foretold the young Knight's destiny as a Lord of the Sith.\\n\\nFor months Freedon Nadd trained the Ketos in Sith magic, but his interests shifted when Exar Kun, a powerful fallen Jedi with dark side curiosities, stirred the Dark Lord's spirit from within his lunar grave. Nadd guided Kun to the ancient Sith homeworld of Korriban where, through a series of trials designed to test his resolve, he decided that Exar Kun was worthy of Sith apprenticeship. Nadd then led Kun to the ancient dwellings of his own Sith Master on Yavin 4 and was pleased when Kun wholeheartedly embraced the Sith after he defeated an enormous Sith wyrm and subjugated the native Massassi warriors. Finally convinced that his apprentice had become one with the dark side, Nadd revealed his need for Exar Kun to create a physical body for him through alchemical means, that he might once again command the power of the Force. Kun, however, refused to entertain Nadd any longer, and in that moment betrayed him. His apprentice's strength tremendously amplified by a Sith amulet, Nadd was attacked by Kun with a potent blast of Force energy that mortally wounded the Sith spirit. Consigned to oblivion for a second time, Nadd contacted the Ketos in his final act and warned them of the threat that Exar Kun posed. He then declared that, along with Ulic Qel-Droma, the future of the Sith rested with Satal and Aleema, before fading into Chaos and dying a second death.\",\n",

It was since used as a zero year for the dating system; thus, the Naboo Crisis takes place in year 3, the Separatist Crisis begins in year 11, Battle of Geonosis takes place in the year 13, the Great Jedi Purge in the year 16, Battle of Yavin in the year 35, and the Battle of Endor in the year 39. The Seventh Battle of Ruusan occurred in the year 965 BrS.\\n\\nDates using the ReSynchronization were written in the following format:\\n:[Year]:[Month]:[Day]\\n:ex. 13:5:21\\n\\nDates after ReSynchronization did not include trailing characters. Dates occurring before the ReSynchronization were followed by \"BrS,\" for Before ReSynchonization:\\n:ex. 4,965 BrS\\n\\nIn 13:2:28, debates occurred within the Republic regarding which zero-point calendar system should be used, with the ReSynchronization thirteen years ago and the Ruusan Reformation being popular contenders.\\n\\nThe dating system introduced with the Great ReSynchronization was still used during the Imperial period, although some Imperials preferred to use the establishment of the Galactic Empire (19 BBY) as the starting point. The Great ReSynchronization system eventually became obsolete under the New Republic and was replaced in 25 ABY with the Galactic Standard Calendar, centered around the Battle of Yavin (0 ABY).',\n",
       " 'Mandalorian Wars': \"The Mandalorian Wars was the term given to the sixteen years of conflict between the Mandalorian warrior culture and the Galactic Republic that began in 3976 BBY with the Battle of Althir. Occurring two decades after the end of the Great Sith War, the Mandalorian Wars spanned almost two decades themselves, though historians often disagreed on the endpoints of the conflict; the Mandalorians raided star systems in the Outer Rim Territories for over a decade before they actually came into conflict with the Republic Military in 3965 BBY. Led by Mandalore the Ultimate, who pioneered the Neo-Crusader movement with the help of his lieutenant, Cassus Fett, the Mandalorians conquered systems along the eastern edge of the galaxy. Though their conquests included the near-extinction of the Cathar species, it was not until their assaults on worlds near the planet Taris that they drew the Republic's attention. After a year of small conflicts known as the False War, the Mandalorians broke through the Republic's lines and besieged Taris in 3963 BBY, and then invaded the Republic through three separate corridors in what became known as the Onslaught.\\n\\nThe tide ultimately turned when a group of interventionist Jedi known as the Revanchists, led by the charismatic Revan and his friend Malak, joined the Republic Military in combating the Mandalorians. A tactical genius, Revan won several victories against the Mandalorians and began to reclaim lost territory, prompting Supreme Chancellor Tol Cressa to appoint him Supreme Commander in 3962 BBY. Driving back the Mandalorians, Revan forced a final showdown with Mandalore the Ultimate at the Battle of Malachor V in 3960 BBY. Revan personally defeated Mandalore in single combat as the Republic and Mandalorian fleets battled above Malachor V, and the activation of the superweapon known as the Mass Shadow Generator devastated both the planet and the participating fleets.\\n\\nThe Mandalorian Wars had long-reaching consequences: Revan forced the defeated Mandalorians to disarm and hid Mandalore's Mask, the symbol of their leadership, and both he and Malak were turned to the dark side of the Force while investigating the Sith influence that had caused Mandalore to go to war. Many of the soldiers and Jedi who followed Revan in the Mandalorian Wars joined the two new Dark Lords of the Sith as they formed their own Sith Empire and invaded the Republic in a subsequent conflict known as the Jedi Civil War.\",\n",

She was created around 7 BBY by the Imperial researchers Simonelle and Massad Thrumble for Prince Xizor, head of the Black Sun crime syndicate. After being sold to Xizor for nine million credits, Guri served as his lieutenant and was one of the few individuals the necessarily paranoid crime lord believed he could trust. Xizor left Guri to attend to much of the day to day running of Black Sun and many incorrectly assumed that she was the leader of the syndicate. Guri also served as an assassin, eliminating several of Xizor's enemies, including Imperial Advisor Fendrilon Koozar, the Ubese bounty hunter Boushh and the leaders of the rival company Ororo Transportation.\\n\\nIn 3 ABY, Xizor charged Guri with arranging the assassination of Luke Skywalker, hero of the Alliance to Restore the Republic and son of Xizor's rival, the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader. After an attempt on Skywalker's life by a Black Sun operative failed, Skywalker's sister Leia Organa sought Xizor's help in uncovering who was behind it. Xizor sent Guri to rendezvous with Organa and bring her to him on Coruscant. Skywalker later attempted to rescue Organa, infiltrating Xizor's Palace and confronting the Dark Prince. During the encounter, Guri fought with Skywalker, but was defeated by the young Jedi. However, Skywalker spared her life and Guri was able to escape the subsequent destruction of the palace.\\n\\nAfter the fall of Black Sun and the death of Xizor, Guri set out on a personal quest to locate Thrumble and get him to purge her assassin programming so she could start a new life, though Xizor's niece, Savan, attempted to stop her and to ensure the droid's continuing service to Black Sun. Despite Savan's efforts, Guri was able to track down Thrumble on Hurd's Moon and was successfully reprogrammed. After defeating Savan, Guri teamed up with Dash Rendar, working together as a mercenary team before agreeing to serve as the template for a new range of human replica droids.\",\n",

Its citizens continued to refer to it as the Galactic Empire or just the Empire, although \"Imperial Remnant\" was still the most common nomenclature used by the rest of the galaxy. It maintained a strong military and limited venues of public expression, but abolished both slavery and anti-alien sentiment. After largely being dismantled following the Battle of Endor, Supreme Commander Gilad Pellaeon reunified the Empire in the Mid Rim and Outer Rim, However, it was challenged by the New Republic as the Galactic Civil War continued. However, it was forced sue for peace after being pushed back into the Outer Rim. In the years that followed, it entered the Yuuzhan Vong War, and joined the Galactic Alliance. However, during another war, it left the Alliance.

However, Daala relinquished full command fleets to Gilad Pellaeon, a devoted follower of the late Grand Admiral Thrawn after the campaign failed, who pulled fleets out of the Deep Core into the outer galaxy, and restored the Imperial Navy and Army, which annexed the Pentastar Alignment, a successor state of the Empire, and established the Council of Moffs and a temporary headquarters on Orinda, and able to expand it borders through a successful campaign in that year. However, Republic advances over the next seven years reduced the Imperial Remnant to just eight sectors and its relocated to Bastion. Pellaeon realized that the war was lost and made peace with the New Republic, ending the Galactic Civil War in 19 ABY.\\n\\nThe Imperial Remnant then entered into a tense but peaceful relationship with the New Republic, and when the latter requested Imperial assistance in repelling an invasion by the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong in 25 ABY, the Moffs elected to instead sit the war out and fortify their own territory against the invaders. After conquering much of the galaxy and capturing the New Republic capital of Coruscant, the Yuuzhan Vong attacked Bastion in 28 ABY and forced an Imperial retreat. Pellaeon was finally able to convince the reluctant Moff Council to take the fight to the enemy, and under his direction, the Imperial Remnant joined the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, the New Republic\\'s successor state. 29 ABY saw the Yuuzhan Vong defeated by the Galactic Alliance\\'s combined fleets at Coruscant, and Pellaeon later retired.\\n\\nAs a member of the Galactic Alliance, the Remnant took part in the brief, but devastating Swarm War in the Unknown Regions along side the Chiss Ascendancy against the Colony during a period of great expansion by the Killik. 41 ABY saw Pellaeon returned as the new Imperial leader when Galactic Alliance Chief of State Darth Caedus requested aid in the Second Galactic Civil War against a Confederation of breakaway planets.

       " 'Mara Jade Skywalker': \"Mara Jade Skywalker was a Force-sensitive human female who was during different times in her life, an Emperor's Hand, a smuggler, and later a Jedi Master who sat upon the Jedi High Council. She was raised as a servant and assassin to Emperor Palpatine and became a high-level Force-using operative. As an Emperor's Hand, Jade carried out the Emperor's bidding, killing Rebels and corrupt Imperials alike with cold professionalism, even as a young woman. As Palpatine's assassin, she received top-notch training from experts in a variety of fields as well as training in the Force, which was continued by Luke Skywalker years later. After Palpatine's death, she received his last command, which was to kill Luke Skywalker; however, the death of her Master caused her to go rogue. Eventually she joined smuggler chief Talon Karrde, becoming one of his best smugglers and his second-in-command. During the predations of Grand Admiral Thrawn, she was forced to work with Skywalker, and developed a grudging respect for him. During the Galactic Civil War, Mara Jade proved herself skilled in a variety of fields; she was a good pilot and mechanic and trained in the use of both a blaster and hand-to-hand combat even without relying on the Force.\\n\\nOver the years, she continued to work for Karrde and interact with Skywalker intermittently, training at his Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4 for a short period of time. She was groomed by Karrde to take over the Smugglers' Alliance and had a brief relationship with Lando Calrissian as part of that role, although she later admitted it was a charade. She also continued to grow closer to Skywalker and worked alongside him on numerous occasions, including the Almanian Uprising and the Corellian Crisis. The two finally realized in 19 ABY while on a mission to Nirauan that they were in love, and wanted to spend the rest of their lives together.\\n\\nAfter marrying Skywalker, Mara Jade took the surname Skywalker and devoted her life to the New Jedi Order, becoming a Master in her own right. Shortly before the Yuuzhan Vong War, she fell ill due to deadly coomb spores that she'd been infected with by a Yuuzhan Vong agent. She used the Force to slow their progress even as she continued to fight against the alien invaders on numerous battlefields including Dantooine and Ithor, but the disease was only purged from her system after the birth of her son Ben in 26 ABY. After becoming a Master, Jade Skywalker took her niece Jaina Solo as an apprentice until she reached Knighthood. During that time, she participated in Jedi offensives against the Yuuzhan Vong, aiding in the war effort. After the fall of Coruscant, she helped Cal Omas become elected as the Chief of State as the New Republic reorganized itself into the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances. Jade Skywalker ultimately saw her efforts against the Yuuzhan Vong rewarded in the war's final battle on Coruscant with the death of Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane.\\n\\nIn the following years, Jade Skywalker was active during the Dark Nest Crisis and the subsequent Swarm War, wherein she helped to thwart the expansionist plans of Raynar Thul and the insectoid Killiks who were spreading into Chiss space and subverting many other people into becoming Joiners under the influence of several Dark Jedi. Jade Skywalker was insistent that the Jedi who had joined Killik communities would be withdrawn, as they were using their skills in combat against the Chiss, provoking them. She continued to serve by the side of her husband as a Jedi Master during the Second Galactic Civil War, first serving alongside the Galactic Alliance against the rebellious Confederation. The re-emergence of the Sith Lady Lumiya was another threat that Jade Skywalker had to confront, but though she and her husband skirmished with both Lumiya and the fallen Jedi Alema Rar on multiple occasions, the darksiders escaped. As the war escalated, Jade Skywalker was killed by her nephew, Jacen Solo, whom she had learned was a Sith and therefore saw as a threat to her family personally, to the Jedi Order, and to the galaxy at large.\",\n",

Despite their many successes, the Mandalorians were decisively defeated by Republic forces under the command of the Jedi Knight Revan, and Ordo was among the survivors who were forced to give up their weapons in unconditional surrender. The Mandalorians scattered across the galaxy and Ordo began working as a mercenary, eventually settling on the planet Taris. Under the employ of local crime lord Davik Kang, Ordo encountered his former enemy, Revan, although Ordo did not recognize him, as Revan was suffering from amnesia and now served as a Republic soldier.\\n\\nHaving grown bored of his life as an enforcer and eager to seek new challenges, Ordo decided to join the Republic soldier and left Taris, traveling with Revan and his companions to Dantooine for a meeting with the local Jedi Council. Revan, who was retrained in the Jedi ways, was given the task of finding the location of the Star Forge, an ancient superweapon being used by Darth Malak's Sith Empire. Ordo accompanied Revan on his mission, confident that he would find new challenges along the way. Contributing his experience as a warrior and commander, Ordo helped Revan throughout his journey, content with having found a task worthy of his efforts. When Revan finally regained his memories and revealed his true identity, Ordo remained loyal and declared that he was proud to serve alongside such a formidable warrior.

Revan soon regained memories of a threat in the Unknown Regions and left known space, instructing Ordo to restore the strength of the Mandalorians in preparation for his return. Ordo then began the arduous task of reuniting the scattered clans and rebuilding their military power. While reestablishing the Mandalorians, Ordo encountered another former opponent from the Mandalorian Wars, Meetra Surik, also known as the Jedi Exile. After learning that Surik was being hunted by the Sith Triumvirate, Ordo decided to aid her in gathering the Jedi Masters who had survived the Sith assassination campaign in order to prevent the Sith from regaining their power. While traveling with Surik, Ordo continued recruiting Mandalorian clans and was instrumental in helping Surik defeat the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus. After Surik eliminated the Sith Triumvirate, Ordo parted ways with her and awaited Revan's return from the Unknown Regions, keeping the Mandalorians ready for war.\",\n",

The war began when he, along with his friend and apprentice Darth Malak, led an invasion of the Galactic Republic in the year 3959 BBY, returning from the Unknown Regions with a massive Sith fleet, seizing control of Korriban, revitalizing the Sith Academy there and gaining access to the Star Forge early on during a mission to Rakata Prime.

       " 'Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi (comic series)': \"Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi, abbreviated as TotJ, is a comic book series covering eight story arcs, all published by Dark Horse Comics. Set during the Old Republic era, six of the eight Tales of the Jedi story arcs take place during the time surrounding the events known collectively as the Great Sith War, a conflict instigated by Sith forces aimed at galactic domination. These six story arcs nominally focus on the Jedi Knight-turned-Sith Lord Ulic Qel-Droma; his love interest, Nomi Sunrider; and a cast of supporting characters, including Ulic's own brother, Cay Qel-Droma. Likewise, first appearing in Dark Lords of the Sith, the fallen Jedi Exar Kun went on to become a Dark Lord of the Sith and wage war against the Republic and Jedi. The remaining two story arcs, The Golden Age of the Sith and The Fall of the Sith Empire, occur in the year 5000 BBY and revolve around Sith Lord Naga Sadow and his schemes to invade Republic space through his manipulation of the Daragon siblings, Gav and Jori.\\n\\nThe first story arc, entitled Ulic Qel-Droma and the Beast Wars of Onderon, was written by veteran Star Wars author Tom Veitch and was part of the first series of comics, which eventually became known as Knights of the Old Republic. Veitch went on to write the next two story arcs, The Saga of Nomi Sunrider and The Freedon Nadd Uprising, and co-authored the fourth story arc, Dark Lords of the Sith, with fellow author Kevin J. Anderson. With the successful completion of Dark Lords of the Sith, Anderson continued the Tales of the Jedi series as the sole storyline writer, with Veitch opting not to continue writing for the series. Anderson went on to write the final two story arcs, involving main protagonist Ulic Qel-Droma, completing The Sith War in the spring of 1996 and Redemption in the fall of 1998. In the years between the writing of The Sith War and Redemption, Anderson pioneered two more story arcs, both taking place 1,000 years before the other Tales of the Jedi stories and introducing readers to the events surrounding the Great Hyperspace War.\\n\\nThe Tales of the Jedi saga also produced several non-comic productions, such as the Tales of the Jedi Companion, a sourcebook for West End Games' Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, and two different audio dramas based on various Tales of the Jedi comics. Tales of the Jedi was the inspiration for the popular Knights of the Old Republic video game series, and a bridging comic has been published by Dark Horse Comics.\",\n",

Situated on the strategically important Hydian Way hyperlane, on the edge of Galactic Republic-controlled space, the Telosian military and economic power bases were considered vital to the survival of the Republic. In addition, the planet played host to the Agricultural Corps, where Jedi who had failed their training were sent to work as farmers and laborers. During one of the earliest battles of the Jedi Civil War, Telos was devastated by forces of the Sith Empire. Under orders from Darth Malak, former Republic admiral Saul Karath demanded the planet's surrender; upon being rebuffed, he carried out his orders to bombard the surface. Soon after, the Jedi Order, fearful of an attack on the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine and the possible loss of many valuable relics, chose Telos as the site for a secret Jedi academy and repository. This academy was eventually taken over by the Echani Handmaidens and Jedi Master Atris, from where she hoped to rebuild the shattered Order.\\n\\nIn the year 3955 BBY, at the behest of Republic Supreme Chancellor Tol Cressa, Telos was chosen as the first planet to undergo a Republic-sponsored restoration effort. This initiative, if successful, would pave the way for the restoration of other planets that had been ravaged during the recent Mandalorian Wars and the conflict wrought by Darths Revan and Malak. The Telosian Restoration Project called for the construction of Citadel Station, an immense space station that orbited the planet, to implement the restoration process. Overseen by the Telosian Council, the Ithorian herd of Chodo Habat was chosen to manage the project. Telos and Citadel Station played a crucial part in the Jedi Exile's mission to end the First Jedi Purge, when the station was attacked by Sith forces under Darth Nihilus. In the wake of the battle, the Sith Triumvirate was defeated; this resulted in the eventual stabilization of the Republic. Due in part to the Exile's efforts, the Restoration Project was ultimately successful, and Telos once again became a lush planet, with many Sacred Places and national parks that drew tourists from throughout the galaxy.\\n\\nIn the final century of the Republic, Telos was a politically significant world, noted for its natural beauty and thriving tourist trade, in addition to the numerous business interests that eagerly established contracts and treaties with the Telosian government. In 53 BBY, the Governor of Telos, a wealthy citizen by the name of Crion, secretly sought to annex a neighboring planet for its valuable minerals and factories. Recruiting his son, the former Jedi Xanatos, as a co-conspirator, a grievous civil war was started by the duo after the Telosian populace was alerted to the scheme, and as a result Crion was slain. Nine years later, Xanatos—having convinced the Telosians of his and his father's innocence—sought to industrialize the natural resources of Telos in a bid for personal power. His plan was foiled, and rather than face judgment for his crimes, Xanatos took his own life. During the early Imperial Period, Telos, along with other planets within Kwymar sector, rebelled against the Galactic Empire. During the Kwymar Suppressions that followed, Telos was once again attacked, ending with an Imperial victory.\",\n",

She was the twin sister of Jacen Solo, the older sister of Anakin Solo, and the wife of pilot Jagged Fel.\\n\\nBorn to Han and Leia Organa Solo, Jaina inherited her father's mechanical aptitude and her mother's Force sensitivity; resulting in her eventual training at the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. During her time there as a youth, she had many adventures, including helping to thwart the Second Imperium, where she helped Zekk abandon the dark side of the Force and join the ranks of the Jedi.\\n\\nWhen the Yuuzhan Vong invaded the galaxy, Jaina joined the New Republic military and distinguished herself as a Rogue Squadron pilot. She was constantly on the front lines of battle during the Yuuzhan Vong War and became known as an avatar of the Trickster Goddess Yun-Harla to the Yuuzhan Vong.\\n\\nDuring the war, Jaina also became romantically involved with fellow pilot Jagged Fel. However, the death of her brother, Anakin caused Jaina to walk dangerously close to the dark side. She was later redeemed with the aid of Kyp Durron. As the war waged on, Jaina discovered a way for the reformed Galactic Alliance to use Yuuzhan Vong warships and biots to their advantage, and also personally slew Warmaster Tsavong Lah in the Battle of Ebaq. Solo fought in many of the war's battles, ultimately participating in its conclusion.

Afterward, she and her brother Jacen commanded Rogue Squadron during the Blockade of Corellia. The resulting crisis; resulted in a split between her and Jacen; due to his increasingly aggressive actions, though she remained active in the Jedi Order. Jaina would later be paired up with Jagged Fel and Zekk on a mission to hunt down the renegade Dark Jedi Alema Rar. The death of her aunt, Mara Jade Skywalker and the dark deeds of her brother only encouraged her to find a way to stop Jacen; who had fallen to the dark side and she began seeking the means to do so through training with her father's ex-arch-enemy, Mandalore Boba Fett. She later killed her twin brother, now the Sith Lord Darth Caedus, in a lightsaber duel aboard the Star Destroyer Anakin Solo.\\n\\nFollowing Jaina's brother's death, she remained an active member of the New Jedi Order. As; such when Chief of State Natasi Daala exiled her uncle, Luke Skywalker, from the New Jedi Order as the beginning of a bid to take control of the Jedi, Jaina created a covert group, Darkmeld, as a means of secretly undermining Daala's efforts.

When the Sith and Abeloth took control of the government on Coruscant, Jaina joined her uncle and several of the other Jedi in an infiltration and surprise assault on the occupiers.

He was the son of former Emperor's Hand and Jedi Master Mara Jade Skywalker and legendary Rebel hero and Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker, the grandson of the Chosen One, Anakin Skywalker, and Padmé Amidala, the cousin of Jacen, Jaina and Anakin Solo, and the ancestor of Cade, Kol and Nat Skywalker. Ben was born amidst the turmoil of the devastating Yuuzhan Vong War, where an extra-galactic species known as the Yuuzhan Vong invaded the galaxy, laying waste to dozens of worlds. As both of his parents were Jedi, they were unable to spend time with him as they fought in the war, so Skywalker was taken care of by his aunt and uncle, former Rebel heroes Han and Leia Solo. He was subsequently moved to the Shelter in the Maw, where many other young Jedi apprentices stayed. The Yuuzhan Vong were eventually repelled and a ceasefire was negotiated, but young Skywalker felt the pain of war through the Force, overwhelming him and causing him to close himself off from the Force for several years.\\n\\nIn 35 ABY, Skywalker, now eight years old, became involved in another galactic crisis. The Killik species had recently been discovered in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy, when a group of Jedi Knights heard their telepathic call and followed it to the Unknown Regions. Skywalker became partially joined to the Gorog Killik nest and formed an owner-pet relationship with one of the Gorog Killiks, who was actually trying to turn him against his mother. However, Ben's parents discovered the Killik's plan and captured it. During this time, Skywalker was taken under the wing of his cousin Jacen Solo, who became his informal Jedi Master. Solo, who had just returned to the New Jedi Order after a five-year journey to learn more about the Force, was able to help Skywalker open himself up to the Force gradually, as Skywalker was still apprehensive about the Force and needed years to become fully adjusted to the Force. With Solo's guidance, Skywalker was able to grow confident in his usage of the Force and become a powerful Jedi.\\n\\nFive years later, the planet of Corellia and the other planets in the Corellian system seceded from the Galactic Alliance, sparking great civil unrest, terrorist attacks, and eventually, the Second Galactic Civil War. During this time, Skywalker joined the Galactic Alliance Guard, a secret police force designed to combat Corellian terrorism, which was led by Jacen Solo. The GAG controversially began interning Corellians on Coruscant, an action which greatly worried his parents. Skywalker was increasingly used on violent missions, including the assassination of Corellian politician Dur Gejjen. Meanwhile, Jacen Solo had fallen to the dark side of the Force under the tutelage of Sith Lady Lumiya, taking the Sith name Darth Caedus. Caedus eventually took over the Galactic Alliance before killing Mara Jade Skywalker. Skywalker correctly believed that Caedus was the killer and attempted to kill Caedus several times, including in a heated battle over Kashyyyk. He decided to legitimately investigate with his friend in the GAG, Lon Shevu, and was able to prove that Caedus had murdered his mother. Eventually Caedus himself was eliminated in a lightsaber duel, and the Second Galactic Civil War ended.\\n\\nIn 43 ABY, Luke Skywalker was exiled from Coruscant by new Galactic Alliance Chief of State Natasi Daala for failing to prevent Jacen Solo's fall to the dark side, until he could prove the causes of Jacen Solo's fall to the dark side. By that time, anti-Jedi sentiment had risen greatly, especially due to an unexplained madness among young Jedi. Skywalker accompanied his father into exile, where the two visited several Force-based organizations with whom Solo had studied during his five-year sojourn—first the Baran Do, where they discovered a secret sect of monks known as the Hidden Ones, then the secretive Aing-Tii, and then the Mind Walkers in a mysterious space station known as Sinkhole Station. While at the station, the two were attacked by a group of Sith, but the two were able to escape. However, Ben and his father continued to cross paths with the Sith, and after a heated encounter on Dathomir, Ben and his father formed an unprecedented alliance with the Sith in order to defeat Abeloth, the supernatural being who was spreading insanity among the Jedi, and allegedly among young Sith apprentices as well. During this alliance, Ben formed a close relationship with the young Sith apprentice Vestara Khai. Eventually, the Sith betrayed their Jedi allies, though Ben and Luke were able to escape and defeat Abeloth, ending the psychosis. Subsequently, Ben and Luke stayed behind with a few Sith to learn more about Abeloth's origins. After further exploration of Abeloth's planet, Ben, Luke, and Vestara faced off against Abeloth and the Sith once again on Pydyr, severing the alliance as the Skywalkers and Vestara continued their hunt for Abeloth. To Luke's dismay, Ben and Vestara's bond continued to grow despite Vestara's multiple betrayals, eventually evolving into a romantic relationship after Vestara was forced to kill her father and turned to the light side.\",\n",

       " 'Kreia': 'Kreia  was an unconventional and highly controversial Force-sensitive who took upon herself to build a new Jedi Order of her vision in freeing the galaxy\\'s sentient beings from being enslaved to the Force. A Human female Jedi Master and historian, Kreia wished to gain a full understanding of the Force, but her unconventional and novel approaches—including her training of the Jedi Knight Revan, who turned against the Jedi and founded a new Sith Empire—prompted a perturbed Jedi Council to exile her from the Jedi Order. Kreia\\'s quest indeed led her astray; she sought contrast with the Jedi ways by opening herself up to the dark side of the Force, but she was overwhelmed by the darkness on the Sith world of Malachor V, where the Mandalorian Wars that Revan waged culminated in the deadly activation of the Mass Shadow Generator superweapon. The echoes of the Malachor tragedy proved overbearing, transforming Kreia into the bitter Sith Lord Darth Traya .\\n\\nWhile Revan had reclaimed his Jedi identity, helping to dismantle the Sith Empire of his own creation in the Jedi Civil War before setting for the Unknown Regions in search of the True Sith, Darth Traya consolidated a Sith Order of her own. And yet, she was betrayed once more by her own Sith apprentices, Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion—both ever-slavishly hungry for power and eager to spread death and suffering (respectively, to a certain degree) across the universe. Watching powerlessly as the two Sith Lords then led the First Jedi Purge, thereby reducing the entirety of The Jedi Order to all but a handful of individuals scattered throughout the known galaxy, Traya soon came to believe that neither the Jedi nor the Sith deserved to win their seemingly-endless war, as both groups stripped their members of all individuality and reduced them to mere dependents of the Force who then ceaselessly wrought war and devastation across the galaxy. But most of all, her experiences caused her to develop a deep-seated hatred for The Force itself and all that it represented on a philosophical level and yearn for its destruction, as she felt this would emancipate the universe from the sort of existential enslavement she believed the Force subjected it, and all its inhabitants, to. Thus, Darth Traya renounced her Sith title and persona and reverted once more to her previous identity of \"Kreia\"—now neither Sith nor Jedi nor anything in between, but rather something altogether outside that simplistic dichotomy.\\n\\nShe then found \"the Jedi Exile,\" a Human female named Meetra Surik whom Kreia saw was the opposite of Revan and his mighty power in the Force. Surik the Exile was instead a void of sorts, a wound in the Force itself, having unconsciously severed her connection to it in the climax of the Battle of Malachor V, carrying with her the countless deaths and unmitigated suffering she undeniably helped wreak in its wake. As the Jedi Council, believing to have seen the \"death of the Force\" within Surik, cast her out of the Order, Kreia decided to seize upon this serendipitous opportunity and take her on as a student. Through the Exile, Kreia intended to rid the universe of the Force and its will, beginning with the extermination of Darths Nihilus and Sion as well as the three Jedi Council members who survived the purge. As Kreia and Surik the Exile grew acquainted with each other, the latter—who easily formed powerful bonds in the Force with others—grew increasingly attached to her new mentor, to the extent that the two became symbionts; so bonded to one another through the Force that they felt each other\\'s pain and their lives became permanently intertwined. Aboard the light freighter Ebon Hawk, Kreia also manipulated those who would soon find themselves traveling alongside Surik and herself as part of her plans for Surik.\\n\\nKreia would aid Surik in locating Jedi Masters Vrook Lamar, Kavar, and Zez-Kai Ell—who had been the ones to originally exile Surik after refusing to fight both the Mandalorians and the Sith, partly out of fear and partly out of a zealous devotion to the prevailing Jedi dogma of their era. Surik convinced the Masters to convene within the ruins of The Dantooine Jedi Enclave, although they would deny that Surik, in letting go of the Force, had become master of her own destiny and was thus able to make her own choices independent of the Force and its seemingly inevitable Will; and declare that Surik\\'s ability to so effortlessly bond with others meant that others grew far too easily attached to her, and would likewise carry all the pain and suffering and death of Malachor V, thereby becoming susceptible to becoming imbalanced themselves, sharing their fates with the fate of Surik herself.\\n\\nFrustrated at what she percieved to be the Masters\\' blindness, Kreia revealed her identity as the Jedi Outcast Kreia and former-Sith Lord Darth Traya and passed her judgment on the Jedi Masters, severing their own bonds to the Force. However, as they were themselves far too attached to the Force to survive without it, the Jedi died, passing on from the Living Force to the Cosmic Force. Shortly after, Kreia traveled to the secret Jedi Academy on Telos IV and exposed Jedi Master Atris\\' fall to the dark side, who was then confronted by Surik. After Surik persuaded Atris to let go of her dark side teachings and leave to find her human self once more, she confronted and destroyed Darth Nihilus over Telos. With the last echoes of her past laid to rest, Surik journeyed to Malachor V to confront Kreia and face her final test.\\n\\nOn Malachor V, Kreia once more assumed the role of Darth Traya. Asserting her dominance over Darth Sion, Traya made preparations for Surik\\'s final test—the death of the past itself. After Surik made her way through the numerous Sith minions on Malachor V, she found Traya within the Trayus Core. Traya explained her overall goal to free the universe from the Force and its influence, as well as her hatred for it and its control over every single being\\'s destiny. Traya told Surik that she must let go of everything other than herself to achieve her full potential: to be a truly freed individual—to live and be herself in the most pure form possible. Traya then delivered unto Surik an ultimatum: either kill her, or Traya would kill Surik. Thus, Surik was forced to betray her now-former master as her now-former master did her, thus severing their ties and letting go of each other. Ultimately, Surik would defeat Traya in the depths of the Trayus Academy, granting her death per the mentor\\'s will. But before Traya died, she imparted a final gift—seeing through the fabrics of the Force, she told Surik of her visions of her, her companions\\', and indeed the entire galaxy\\'s future.\\n\\nSurik then proceeded to destroy the Trayus Academy, bringing an end to its call of darkness before leaving to the Unknown Regions in seach of Kreia\\'s former student, Revan. Together, they would face the True Sith Emperor, Vitiate. Although they would be killed by the Sith\\'s enforcers, Surik and Revan clung on as spirits before eventually choosing to let go of themselves for the fate of the galaxy. As Force ghosts, they passed on their legacies to the Commander of the Eternal Alliance, an individual whose organization became independent of the Force-based dogma of the Jedi and Sith Orders, uniting people of differing allegiances to forge a new galaxy free of authorities such as Emperors and wars such as the war against Zakuul. However, this apparent progress would be undone by the Third Galactic War and the New Sith Wars, as well as the era of the Sith Rule of Two. Thus, despite Kreia\\'s ambition, the galaxy would inevitably find itself embroiled in a series of highly destructive conflicts between the light and dark sides of the Force once more.',\n",

They differed from baseline Human stock in a number of ways, most notably in that they possessed poor night vision and were considered to be, on average, more attractive than the typical Human standard for beauty. Due to the Transitory Mists that surround the Hapes Cluster, the Hapans were isolated from the rest of the galaxy both culturally and genetically.\\n\\nBecause most of the male population, which made up the Lorell Raiders pirate gang, was largely wiped out by the Jedi around 4000 BBY, the Hapans adopted a matriarchal society and were ruled by a Queen Mother. The first Queen Mother closed the borders of the Hapes Cluster to the galaxy at large, which resulted in the Hapans dealing with intruders swiftly and lethally. Over the years, interaction between Hapans and the rest of the Galaxy was extremely limited, due to their enforced isolation. However, in 8 ABY, the Hapans opened their borders to the rest of the Galaxy, which dramatically increased their contact with the outside universe.',\n",

Incarcerated in the spice mines of Kessel by the Galactic Empire at an early age, Durron's deep anger against his imprisoners was easily exploited by the spirit of Dark Lord of the Sith Exar Kun, once Han Solo rescued the young Force-sensitive and took him to Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4. Under Kun's guidance, Durron stole the Sun Crusher superweapon and embarked upon a vendetta, destroying several Imperial targets and unwittingly killing his own brother in the process. Only after Kun's influence had been banished did Durron begin a long quest for absolution which led him to become Skywalker's most talented pupil and one of the first Jedi Masters of the New Jedi Order.\\n\\nDespite Durron's reformation, his desire to repent for his actions manifested itself in a high-profile campaign against smugglers in the Outer Rim Territories as part of a philosophy of direct action against those whom he perceived as wrong-doers. When the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong attacked the galaxy in 25 ABY, Durron was one of the first to meet the threat, losing his apprentice and many other fellow Jedi in the opening months of the war. His policy of aggressive action was enhanced in the face of the Yuuzhan Vong menace and Durron began leading like-minded Jedi to war, against the wishes of Skywalker. Following further losses, Durron briefly took Jaina Solo as his apprentice and was later reconciled with Skywalker following Galactic Alliance Chief of State Cal Omas' creation of the High Council, upon which both men had seats. Durron saw the war through to its conclusion and remained one of Skywalker's leading advisors on the newly formed Jedi High Council.\\n\\nIn 35 ABY, when a border conflict between the Chiss Ascendancy and the insectoid Killik species flared out of control, a group of younger Jedi departed to fight on behalf of the Killiks, provoking Chief of State Omas to attempt to gain more control over the Jedi Order. Durron, as the proponent of the philosophy that Jedi should follow the guidance of the Force rather than the policies of the reigning government, stridently opposed Omas, upholding his principles throughout the course of the conflict. The Jedi Master later found himself fighting the Galactic Alliance directly during the Second Galactic Civil War, when Jaina Solo's twin brother Jacen Solo took control of the government and attempted to impose Sith rule upon the galaxy as Darth Caedus. Following Jacen Solo's defeat, the galaxy entered into a period of reformation under the direction of Chief of State Natasi Daala, one of Durron's former Imperial enemies. Daala's policies included attempts to curb the autonomy of the Jedi Order, which Durron weathered alongside the emerging threat of a mysterious Force psychosis.\",\n",

She was a member of a rogue sect of Jedi, led by Master Djinn Altis, who were accepted back by the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars to take command of clone troopers and fight for the Republic. During the war, she followed Altis into battle on the planet JanFathal alongside a contingent of clones and two orthodox Jedi, Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano, in order to rescue a Republic Intelligence agent, Hallena Devis. After the war, Masana survived the initial stages of the Great Jedi Purge and made contact with other survivors on the planet Belsavis.\\n\\nWhen the automated Imperial dreadnaught Eye of Palpatine came to demolish the settlement, Masana and her lover Geith Eris launched a desperate mission to sabotage the ship. They were successful, but in the process, Masana shed her physical body, remaining embedded in the ship\\'s computer as a spirit. Many years later, Luke Skywalker and several other Jedi were brought onto the ship as it resumed its mission. Masana, in spirit form, communicated and began to fall in love with Skywalker. She later took the body of one of the other Jedi, Cray Mingla, after Mingla gave it up to stop the superweapon once and for all. However, in the process, Masana, now using the surname \"Ming,\" lost her ability to touch the Force.\\n\\nDespite this loss, Ming helped thwart Admiral Natasi Daala and the Death Seed plague conspiracy, though she and Skywalker parted ways forever. On her journey to rediscover the Force, Ming encountered the dark side entity Abeloth, who absorbed her life essence and took over her body. Abeloth then used Ming\\'s spirit to reach out to Skywalker as he traveled to her, and tried to convince him that she was in fact Ming when he confronted her. Skywalker was surprised to realize how much he still loved Ming after so many years, but he was not fooled by Abeloth\\'s trickery. After facing her numerous times, Skywalker was finally able to detach Ming from Abeloth and the physical world, causing her to disappear into the light side of the Force.',\n",

Before Hoth and Othone became involved with the New Sith Wars, they visited backwater planets on the Outer Rim, staying far away from the Core of the galaxy and politics in general. However, Hoth later created the Army of Light to fight the Brotherhood of Darkness in the New Sith Wars. Othone fought with Hoth during this time, especially during the Ruusan campaign, though his master was killed when the Sith detonated a thought bomb on Ruusan. The blast affected all Force-sensitives on the planet, killing all of the Sith, with the exception of Darth Bane, and Jedi on the world at the time. Othone had evacuated Ruusan with thousands of other Jedi and soldiers of the Republic, and survived the blast. Othone had fears that a Sith survived the blast, though he was convinced otherwise by Valenthyne Farfalla, a Half-Bothan Jedi Master who later took Othone as his Padawan.\\n\\nOthone accompanied Farfalla to Coruscant, the capital of the Republic, for a meeting with the Supreme Chancellor, Tarsus Valorum, concerning the Ruusan Reformation. There, changes were made to the Republic, resulting in the dissolution of the Army of Light. After the meeting, Farfalla knighted Othone and gave him a mission to protect Valorum as a Chancellor's Guard. Othone protected Valorum throughout his two terms as chancellor and became his advisor after Valorum stepped down from his position. In 990 BBY, Othone saved Valorum's life from the Anti-Republic Liberation Front, which put the former chancellor in debt with the Jedi. In gratitude, Valorum convinced the Galactic Senate to build a memorial on Ruusan as a tribute to Othone's master, Hoth, and the other Jedi who died to destroy the Sith. Othone, monitoring the construction of the memorial, had his fears of a surviving Sith confirmed when the failed Jedi, Darovit, came forward, revealing the presence of a Sith named Bane and his apprentice Zannah, who was Darovit's cousin. Othone told Farfalla of the surviving Sith; he convinced his former master of Bane's and Zannah's existence, and Othone, Farfalla, and three other Jedi—Sarro Xaj, Raskta Lsu, and Worror Dowmat—confronted the Sith on Tython.

In 9 ABY, the insane clone Jedi Master Joruus C'baoth performed a mind trick on Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn's subordinate, Captain Gilad Pellaeon, ordering him to make a special clone for him. The clone that later became Luuke Skywalker was grown in secret from sample B-2332-54, the sorting code assigned to Luke Skywalker's hand. The clone was grown in a Spaarti cloning cylinder over the period of less than a month. When he was ready, the clone was given Jedi training by C'baoth and over time became little more than an extension of C'baoth's will.\\n\\nC'baoth wished to turn Skywalker and the former Emperor's Hand Mara Jade over to the dark side and take them on as his apprentices.

The clone's presence caused a buzzing pressure to form within Skywalker's mind, and Skywalker was constantly put on the defensive as the clone attacked with vicious thrusts of his lightsaber. The clone proved to have a similar proficiency in lightsaber dueling and Force techniques as Skywalker, utilizing Force attacks such as lightsaber throw. Eventually, Skywalker's sister, Leia Organa Solo, entered the throne room but was quickly neutralized by C'baoth. As Skywalker continued to lose ground to the clone, Jade found an opportunity to recover Leia's lightsaber. Jade was able to slip under the clone's guard and kill him, and C'baoth was killed shortly thereafter. However, the entire experience went on to traumatize Skywalker in the days following.\",\n",

He served in the Republic Naval Starfighter Corps, fighting for the Galactic Republic he loved above all else in such conflicts as the Mandalorian Wars against expanding Mandalorian clans, earning several honors for his bravery during combat. During the war, Onasi served under Admiral Saul Karath, who would become his greatest ally and mentor. After the war ended, Onasi planned to leave the Navy and return to Telos to be with his family.\\n\\nHowever, such plans were put to an end when war heroes Revan and Malak, two Jedi who had decided to fight in the war, turned on the Republic, becoming Sith Lords while taking many Jedi that had followed him to war and the Republic soldiers who served under them with them when they created a Sith Empire that would oppose the Republic. During that conflict, Telos was attacked by Karath—who bombed the planet from his flagship, Leviathan, until it was made completely uninhabitable so he could prove his loyalty to the Sith. The orbital bombardment killed Morgana while Dustil, being Force-sensitive, was abducted by the Sith so he could be trained as a Dark Jedi. Onasi swore to seek revenge against Karath for the death of his family and the destruction of his homeworld; he would hold that grudge for three years.\\n\\nAt that time, 3956 BBY, Onasi played a crucial role in the search for the Star Forge, the Sith's super-productive space factory that continually fed their fleet new ships. He was stationed aboard the Hammerhead-class cruiser Endar Spire over the planet Taris when it was attacked by the Sith, now lead by Malak after he had usurped control from Revan. The former leader was then reprogrammed by the Jedi and made to forget his time as both a Jedi and a Sith before being placed in the Republic's armed forces aboard the Spire, where he met Onasi as the two were both fleeing the doomed ship. They temporarily settled on Taris while searching for Jedi Knight Bastila Shan, the only other person known to have survived the attack on the Endar Spire.\\n\\nAfter finding her, the three fled Taris and Onasi would serve as the pilot of the Ebon Hawk, their personal starship, transporting the trio and a growing group of allies across the galaxy as they searched for Star Maps that would lead them to the Star Forge, a mission given to them by the Jedi Council. As they traveled through the stars, Onasi was able to both find his son, who was then turned from the Sith ways by Revan and his father, as well as enact his revenge upon Karath, whom the group killed aboard the Leviathan. Once the Star Forge was located and destroyed during the Battle of Rakata Prime, Onasi was made an admiral in the Republic Navy, taking a leading role in the effort to help the Republic recover in the wake of the two subsequent wars. To this end, Onasi would later defend Telos from another Sith attack during another conflict that would stem from the Jedi Civil War Revan and Malak began almost a decade before.\",\n",

The tank required a crew of four battle droids to be fully operated and was able to carry six additional battle droids onto the battlefield. The tank's reactor and power and communications gear were kept in the rear for protection.\\n\\nThe vehicle was designed by the Baktoid Armor factories, with its most important parts placed in the back. Piloted by OOM pilot battle droids, AATs comprised a significant portion of the Trade Federation's ground forces.

The ship's speed and agility, combined with its arsenal of four laser cannons, two ion cannons, two warhead launchers, and an optional tractor beam projector, made it arguably the most advanced starfighter available at the time.\\n\\nAfter Zaarin's failed coup against Emperor Palpatine, the renegade admiral attempted to gain control of the TIE Defender technology to give his forces a technological advantage over the Empire. The advanced starfighter also attracted the attention of other factions, including the Rebel Alliance and pirate groups. Imperial forces under the command of Grand Admiral Thrawn were ultimately able to prevent the spread of the technology and the starfighter played a major role in Thrawn's successful campaign against Zaarin.\\n\\nBeyond the Zaarin campaign, the TIE Defender's high cost, together with political factors, kept it from achieving widespread use in the Empire and units were assigned only to the most elite pilots. The fighters participated in several other engagements during the Imperial era, including the Battle of Mygeeto and the Battle of Endor. Following the death of Emperor Palpatine at Endor, the TIE Defender continued to see limited use by Imperial forces. TIE Defenders saw action during Shadowspawn's campaign against the New Republic in 5 ABY and were used by the Republic's Rogue Squadron during a brief alliance with former Director of Imperial Intelligence Ysanne Isard against Prince-Admiral Delak Krennel's Ciutric Hegemony in 9 ABY.

       " 'James Luceno': 'James Luceno is an American author who has written numerous books in the Star Wars universe, including eight novels in the Star Wars Legends continuity and two within the new canon. Born in 1947, he was raised as a military brat; television re-runs of classic movies watched in his youth fostered his love of storytelling. His early adulthood found him playing bass in rock bands throughout New York and New Jersey, and being on the road with The Manhattan Transfer fueled his love of traveling. Much of the 1970s saw Luceno embark on various globetrotting adventures, and a detailed journal he kept of his experiences eventually blossomed into his first novel. He also met Brian Daley, a fellow traveler and aspiring writer, during this decade, and the two became close friends and collaborators, writing together for the 1986 cartoon The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers and later jointly penning the popular Robotech novels under the pseudonym Jack McKinney. They were also approached by Del Rey Books about relaunching its Star Wars fiction line, but the publisher ultimately lost its licensing rights, and in 1996 Daley passed away from pancreatic cancer.\\n\\nA number of adventure and science fiction novels by Luceno were released in the 1980s and 1990s, and when Del Rey regained the right to publish Star Wars fiction, they hired him to help oversee a massive multi-author series called The New Jedi Order. While overseeing its planning and development, Luceno also contributed three books to the project, and he additionally wrote Cloak of Deception, a 2001 lead-in novel to Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. The rest of the decade added several more Star Wars novels and reference guides to his résumé, and his acclaimed Darth Plagueis was released in 2012 following a tumultuous development period that originally saw it shelved in 2007. Luceno successfully pushed for its revival, and the five years between its pitch and publication gave him unprecedented time to work on and perfect it. When the Expanded Universe was re-branded as Star Wars Legends in 2014, he was one of several novelists hired to contribute to the new canon, and his most recent book, Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel, was published in 2016.',\n",

A consummate warrior, he was the embodiment of his caste, over whom he held jurisdiction second only to that of the Supreme Overlord. He succeeded his father as Warmaster at the time of the invasion, although he entered the galaxy somewhat later than the advance forces. This did not prevent him, however, from manipulating events behind the scenes, arranging for the destruction of Ithor and the disgrace of the rival Domain Shai, as well as overseeing several key victories, before finally emerging in 26 ABY as the architect of the Battle of Duro. Lah became infamous among both his own species and the citizens of the New Republic for his vendetta against the Jedi; following a defeat at the hands of Jacen Solo, the Warmaster called for the surrender of all Force-sensitives to the Yuuzhan Vong, prompting a wholesale persecution of the New Jedi Order. Indirectly, this was to contribute towards the beginnings of the Jeedai heresy, an underground movement among the Shamed Ones which, on the moon Yavin 4, Lah was unsuccessful in eradicating.\\n\\nAn obsession soon followed with securing the capture of Solo twins Jacen and Jaina; the Warmaster wished to sacrifice the two Jedi to the Yuuzhan Vong gods in order to bless his advance upon the Core Worlds. The twin sacrifice refused to bear fruit; nonetheless, Lah went on to lead the costly, yet ultimately successful, encirclement and capture of the New Republic capital, Coruscant. Intrigue among the priests and shapers who attended him during this period, however, led to the deliberate sabotage of one of the warmaster's implants, forcing Lah to retreat from the forefront of the invasion. The Warmaster's over-extension of the Yuuzhan Vong fleet, as well as his incapacitation, allowed the New Republic to recover somewhat from the numerous defeats they had sustained at his hands. Lah's eventual return to leadership capacity was thus overshadowed by the deaths of his son and father, both of whom died on campaigns of his design. Even the capture of the prized Jacen Solo proved to be a failure, as the Jedi defected insincerely to the Yuuzhan Vong, destabilized events on the newly terraformed Coruscant, and escaped, all immediately prior to the arrival Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane.\\n\\nHeavily criticized by the Supreme Overlord of the Yuuzhan Vong for his costly victories and personal vendettas, Lah was ordered to postpone any further attacks upon the remaining defenders of the galaxy until the depleted warrior caste could be replenished. Given ample time to prepare themselves, the New Republic military and its counterparts in intelligence set in motion a trap to lure the Warmaster to his death. Disinformation and the careful subversion of the Yuuzhan Vong spy network encouraged Tsavong Lah's contemporary, the executor Nom Anor, to trust evidence suggesting that the Warmaster could attain a crucial victory at Ebaq 9, a forgotten moon in the Deep Core. Eager to destroy his enemy in a last decisive battle, the Warmaster mobilized a massive armada and descended upon Ebaq 9. Ambushed, outnumbered and defeated by a host of New Republic fleets, Tsavong Lah accepted his fate, choosing to lead his warriors on one final crusade against Jedi present at the battle. In a brief, fierce duel with his long-time adversary, Jaina Solo, Tsavong Lah perished.\",\n",

However, she achieved success thanks to Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, who discovered her after she defeated many skilled Imperial opponents in simulated battles, using an alias to hide her true identity. Tarkin took her under his wing, and as he rose in the ranks, so did she. She became his lover and was eventually promoted to admiral by him. Shortly thereafter, she was sent to oversee the top-secret Imperial research facility known as the Maw Installation.

Following the death of Caedus, she became the new Chief of State of the Galactic Alliance. After attempting to fix what Caedus had done, she displayed a strong anti-Jedi sentiment, exiling Luke Skywalker as part of a backlash against the Jedi. However, after she ordered a siege of the Jedi Temple and entered a severe dispute with the acting Grand Master, Kenth Hamner, her actions caused her to be perceived more negatively by the public and viewed as a tyrant by the Jedi. Unable to handle her increasingly extreme policies, a group of Jedi led a coup to depose her. Sent to prison, Daala was able to escape from confinement with the help of the bounty hunter Boba Fett and began to plan her revenge on those who had removed her from power.\\n\\nThanks to Boba Fett's intelligence, Daala blackmailed several members of the Council of Moffs to join her in overthrowing Head of State Jagged Fel and taking control of the Imperial Remnant. However, the betrayal of Moff Tol Getelles and the arrival of Empire of the Hand ships to support Fel forced Daala into a siege at Exodo II. As Daala and Fel faced off, political instability erupted in the Remnant and, under the advice of Lieutenant Lydea Pagorski, Daala offered to compete with Fel in a general election for Head of State. Daala campaigned against Fel and Admiral Vitor Reige. Despite Fel's withdrawal, Reige defeated Daala, ending her ambitions.\",\n",

The Wraiths were designed to fulfill the mission responsibilities of both a traditional starfighter squadron and a commando unit—a revolutionary concept in tactics for the New Republic, and one that its founder felt was an essential development for the New Republic.\\n\\nThe Wraiths first saw action against Admiral Apwar Trigit, which resulted in the destruction of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Implacable and the death of Trigit following a prolonged campaign that started with the Wraiths' seizure of the modified Corellian corvette Night Caller. Following Trigit's demise in the Battle of Ession, they continued to mount a number of often unorthodox covert operations against Warlord Zsinj. At one point, members of Wraith Squadron posed as a pirate group in an attempt to become employed by Zsinj. They were successful in that aim, which allowed them to assist in the destruction of the Executor-class Star Dreadnought Razor's Kiss. During this time, Garik Loran assumed command of Wraith Squadron from Wedge Antilles. Afterward, they returned to more normal fleet service in a lengthy campaign against Zsinj, culminating in the Battle of Selaggis, an engagement made possible by a double agent from Wraith Squadron who was stationed aboard Zsinj's flagship, the Iron Fist. At Selaggis, the Wraiths helped scatter Zsinj's forces, believing they had destroyed the Iron Fist and largely defeated Zsinj himself.\\n\\nTheir success was such that the unit was then moved from Starfighter Command to the New Republic Intelligence Service, undertaking missions such as the elimination of Imperial admiral Kosh Teradoc in 13 ABY. Wraith Squadron continued to play a vital, if unique role in the military into the Yuuzhan Vong War, during which its members jammed yammosk war coordinators, flew covert missions behind enemy lines, crafted a psychological campaign by helping Jaina Solo impersonate a Yuuzhan Vong deity, and infiltrated Coruscant. After the New Republic government transitioned into the Galactic Alliance, the Wraiths served the reformed government through the Swarm War.\\n\\nFollowing the Second Galactic Civil War, the Wraiths were viewed with suspicion by the new Daala administration and disbanded. However, Daala's ousting in 43 ABY by the Jedi Order gave the Wraiths a new chance at life when former commander Garik Loran was asked by the head of Galactic Alliance Security, Borath Maddeus, to investigate the chief of the Galactic Alliance Army, General Stavin Thaal, for treason. Loran unofficially assembled two Wraith Squadron teams led by unit veterans, one under Bhindi Drayson and another under Sharr Latt, and kept them isolated from each other. The two units separately discovered evidence of Thaal's duplicity while Loran was also able to implicate Maddeus as a co-conspirator with Thaal. Following Thaal's and Maddeus's exposure, Loran was promoted to head of Galactic Alliance Security and unofficially reinstated Wraith Squadron.\",\n",

Born prior to the year 6 ABY, Anor was dispatched as an agent and saboteur to a galaxy other than the Yuuzhan Vong's own to prepare the way for the intended invasion. From the edge of the galaxy where the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Yong has established themselves, Anor worked behind the scenes, and scouted out the battlefield ahead of schedule, gathering information, and destabilized the galaxy where he could by inciting conflicts that would make the Yuuzhan Vong's task easier when they went to war. He manipulated the Imperial Ruling Council and contributed to its downfall, and helped create numerous flashpoints of trouble over his years working in the galaxy.\\n\\nIn 25 ABY, Anor—ranked as an Executor by this time—sided with the Intendant caste's Praetorite Vong, and aided them in being the initial strike force of the invasion, though they would fail against the forces of the New Republic despite Anor's efforts; at the same time, his destabilization work culminated in starting a full-scale war between the planets of Osarian and Rhommamool. Anor also helped found the Peace Brigade organization, a group who would go on to aid the Yuuzhan Vong in their conquest over the course of the war. Later changing allegiances slightly to aid the warrior caste as they took up the invasion, the Executor helped plan an assassination attempt against members of the New Jedi Order, with the help of other Yuuzhan Vong, though their plot fell apart in the Bilbringi system. Later that year, Anor went on to establish relations between the Hutt species and the Yuuzhan Vong, and was instrumental in using the double-dealing Hutts to convince the New Republic that an imminent Yuuzhan Vong attack would occur at the world of Corellia, instead of at the actual target: the shipyards in the Fondor system. Anor participated in the attack that caught the New Republic unawares, though the glory of arranging such a grand victory for his people was swept from his grasp when much of both fleets were destroyed by a blast from the Centerpoint Station superweapon.\\n\\nFollowing the disaster at Fondor, Anor helped in successfully clearing the way for a Yuuzhan Vong invasion of the heavily polluted world of Duro, though his later efforts to sabotage the defensive systems in the Yag'Dhul system to prepare for an attack were compromised by Jedi involvement. In 27 ABY, the Executor was dispatched alongside Vergere to prevent a Jedi strike team from eliminating the queen of the Jedi-hunting voxyn on the world of Myrkr, and to capture the Jedi Solo twins. The agent was only partly successful in his mission, detaining only Jacen Solo while the queen was slain, and Anor was further undermined in the eyes of his superiors after he inadvertently let Solo escape from Yuuzhan Vong custody with Vergere.\\n\\nIn seeking to provide a culminating victory for his people, Anor was tricked into following a trial of false information dropped by New Republic operatives, and led Warmaster Tsavong Lah into a massive defeat in the Treskov system, where the Warmaster perished against the forces arrayed there. Anor fled to the underworld of the Alliance capital Coruscant, now occupied by the Yuuzhan Vong and renamed Yuuzhan'tar, throwing his lot in with the Shamed Ones who believed in the Jeedai heresy to escape retribution for his failure. The disgraced agent eventually chose to lead the heretics as the prophet Yu'shaa in a bid to regain more power. Discovering evidence that the legendary living world of Zonama Sekot was in fact real, Anor briefly teamed up with Jedi Knights and rogue Yuuzhan Vong to find the planet, though he ultimately betrayed them and the world to win back the graces of Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane. However, although promoted to prefect, Anor soon became disillusioned with Jamaane's rule, and once again took up the role of the Prophet to lead the heretics against the Supreme Overlord as the Jedi and the Galactic Alliance attempted to retake Coruscant. In the end, Anor was captured by the Jedi, while the Yuuzhan Vong surrendered after the death of Jamaane. Realizing that the future held nothing but uncertainty for him, Anor chose to remain on a disintegrating starship as it fell apart over the reclaimed Coruscant.\",\n",

Born on Imperial Center during the height of Galactic Emperor Palpatine's reign over the majority of the galaxy, Brie dedicated herself to the tenets of the Imperial New Order doctrine. This garnered the interest of Palpatine's chief enforcer, the Sith Lord Darth Vader, who sped the young woman's advancement in various Imperial-sponsored programs, including her enrollment into the Intelligence Academy of Carida. After she graduated with top honors and was promoted to the rank of major by Vader himself, Brie was given a highly classified mission to infiltrate the Rebel Alliance and either cause the death or ostracism of Rebel hero and Jedi Luke Skywalker amongst his peers. Brie achieved the latter, but the events that ended in Skywalker's disgrace also left her horribly disfigured and near death. She was recovered by Darth Vader, who rehabilitated her with cybernetic replacements much like his own. Brie then began to train in the dark side of the Force at the feet of Vader under the assumed identity of Lumiya, Dark Lady of the Sith.\\n\\nWhile Lumiya studied in secret as Lord Vader's Shadow Hand, she also served as one of the Emperor's Hands—Force-trained assassins who answered to Palpatine himself. She embarked on a pilgrimage to the world of Ziost, during which she crafted her own lightwhip. While on that sojourn, however, both Palpatine and Darth Vader perished in battle at Endor, and as the foremost of their pupils despite her incomplete training, she defaulted to Mistress of the Sith. Purpose-driven toward vengeance against Luke Skywalker and the Alliance for the deaths of her Sith Masters, she apprenticed an ex-stormtrooper named Flint and lent support to the extra-galactic Nagai species' war against their mortal Tof enemies. The Sith Lady suffered a critical defeat early in her campaign, the damage from which required replacement of her armor, and saw the debut of a triangular headdress that, along with her lightwhip, henceforth became her trademark. She continued to aid the Nagai, during which time she confronted and ultimately lost to her sworn enemy, Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. As the Nagai–Tof War commenced, however, the Dark Lady escaped Skywalker's custody, with promises of mayhem for him when next they met. She subsequently ended her partnership with the Nagai in favor of the Tof opposition, but their swift defeat by the unified forces of the Alliance, Empire, and Nagai signified the end of the war. Thought by the majority of the galaxy to be dead, Lumiya retreated to the Outer Rim with retribution ever on her mind.\\n\\nWhile in hiding, the Dark Lady prepared a fleet in preparation for a strike against the New Republic, the successor government to the Rebel Alliance. She once again worked closely with Imperial Intelligence and took the second of her apprentices, former Imperial Royal Guardsman Carnor Jax, after the mysterious death of her first. Together Lumiya and Jax eliminated the last vestiges of the Prophets of the Dark Side cult. She then charged him with the infiltration of the Imperial Ruling Council in anticipation of a threat to her Sith Order, while she herself brokered for additional assets with Imperial Regent Ysanne Isard. However, Jax's own nascent ambitions led him into an ill-conceived attempt at betrayal against Lumiya, and another former Royal Guardsman, Kir Kanos, killed Jax, leaving the Dark Lady once again without an apprentice. She returned to the planet Korriban to plot strategy and, in possession of the ancient Sith oracle stone artifact, continued to monitor galactic events from afar. By 25 ABY, though, Lumiya had abandoned the Outer Rim in favor of the former asteroid dwelling of the ancient Sith Lord Vectivus, where she mastered the creation of his dark side–empowered Force phantoms. That same year, she considered an invitation by a new order of Sith on Korriban, who sought to bring the Dark Lady into their fold, but was delayed en route by advance scouts of the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong race on the eve of their galactic invasion. She eluded capture and attempted to undermine the Yuuzhan Vong offensive in her own way from the shadows.\\n\\nAs the galaxy descended further into chaos, Lumiya came to believe that only the supreme will of a Dark Lord of the Sith could impose order and stability. It was while cultivating such beliefs that she met the Fosh ex-Jedi–turned–Sith Vergere, and through the latter's superior knowledge, Lumiya's training was complete. Together they conspired to restore peace to the galaxy through the creation and ascension of the next Sith Lord. Lumiya ignored a second offer of alliance from those on Korriban, as Lumiya and Vergere contrived to bring the Skywalker family's Sith legacy full circle through Jacen Solo, the grandson of Darth Vader. She and Vergere facilitated Solo's capture by the Yuuzhan Vong, to whom Vergere had ingratiated herself, and the Fosh began the training that Lumiya would eventually finish. Vergere died three years into the Yuuzhan Vong War with her role in the affair complete, but another twelve passed before Lumiya was prepared to uphold her end of the bargain. In 40 ABY, she enacted her plan to beguile Solo against the backdrop of a new war, one consequent of her clandestine instigation, by aggravating the already tepid relationship between the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances and the Corellian system's Five Worlds government. An orchestrated series of events led Solo to Lumiya's home, which resulted in his agreement to take up the way of the Sith. For months she trained him, while continuing her secret manipulations of Corellia's separatist movement and enlisting the services of the Twi'lek darksider Alema Rar in the process. Lumiya then revealed herself to the Jedi and maneuvered their determination to eliminate her into a distraction from Jacen Solo's utter embrace of the dark side as the Sith Lord Darth Caedus. Satisfied that vengeance had been cemented against her enemies, Lumiya surrendered herself to death in combat against her long-time nemesis, Luke Skywalker.\",\n",

Lemelisk adjusted the plans to the Hutt's wishes, removing all the Imperial padding and leaving only the central superlaser weapon, encased in a cylindrical durasteel shell. The resulting shape closely resembled that of the lightsaber, the traditional weapon of the Jedi Knights, so Lemelisk christened his creation accordingly: the Darksaber.\\n\\nLocated in the Hoth asteroid field, the Darksaber Project, as it was also known, was financed by Orko SkyMine Asteroid Processing Corporation, a faux corporation owned by Durga.

By that time, the New Republic became aware of Durga's superweapon and tracked his yacht to the Darksaber's construction site.

As Antilles's forces attacked the Darksaber, Durga took his weapon into the most dangerous part of the asteroid field, where the Darksaber's way was blocked by two massive asteroids. Durga tried to use the superlaser to clear the path, but the weapon did not work, and the Darksaber was crushed by the asteroids.

During the Galactic Civil War between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Kaadara was garrisoned by Imperial forces in an effort to crack down on rebellious activity on Naboo. Meanwhile, the Royal Naboo Security Force, having since supplanted the Gungan defense force, fought hard to defend the city from criminal elements, including those belonging to a gang of renegade slicers known as the Skaak Tippers. Under the rule of Queen Kylantha, Kaadara also played host to the Festival of Love, where it welcomed Ewoks from the Bright Tree Village of Endor to share their rich culture with the people of Naboo.\",\n",

       " 'Ood Bnar': \"Ood Bnar was a Neti Jedi Master who lived for over five thousand years, from before the Great Hyperspace War in 5000 BBY until 10 ABY. Bnar was born on the planet Ryyk, but found himself stranded on Myrkr during his youth. He eventually joined the Jedi Order, and over time became one of the most respected and revered Masters of the era. Bnar specialized in the history of the Sith, and preferred to avoid combat where possible, though he often advised more martial Jedi on how best to fight the dark side. Eventually, he had such knowledge of Jedi and Sith lore that he recorded a holocron, which was passed down through the generations for centuries.\\n\\nBnar eventually became the understudy of Head Librarian Odan-Urr at the Great Jedi Library on Ossus, and after his friend's death at the hands of Exar Kun during the Great Sith War in 3996 BBY, Bnar took over his role as Head Librarian. However, his reign would not last long. He was among the Jedi who discovered that they would have little time to evacuate before Ossus was destroyed by a Sith-created supernova in the nearby Cron Cluster. While the other Jedi hurried to save as much as they could, Bnar went to his bundle of ancient lightsabers, hoping they would survive the shockwave heading for the planet. However, he was interrupted by Exar Kun, who had come to Ossus to scavenge any artifacts left behind. Knowing he could not defeat the Dark Lord of the Sith, Bnar transformed into a giant and immovable tree, barring Kun from the trove of sabers.\\n\\nBnar survived the devastation of Ossus, and entered a millennia-long slumber. He became known as the place of Ascension to the native Ysanna tribe who for 4,000 years had performed the ritual of ascent there, believing that he was the source of Ysanna magic. He was awakened in 10 ABY to find Luke Skywalker and Kam Solusar facing off against a Dark Side Elite named Sedriss QL, who had taken a native girl hostage. Bnar freed the girl and gripped Sedriss tightly with his roots. The darksider attempted to use the dark energies contained in Ossus's skies against Bnar, but the Neti fought back, counteracting Sedriss's attack by using the powers rooted deep in the Ossus ground. He eventually sacrificed himself to stop Sedriss and save the two Jedi and the native.\",\n",

He began his career in the organization of Jorj Car'das, where he moved quickly through the ranks to become one of Car'das's top lieutenants. When Car'das disappeared in 0 BBY, Karrde quickly and quietly took over the organization to avoid internal feuding. The smuggling and information-brokering organization was already formidable, and when Jabba Desilijic Tiure was killed in 4 ABY, Karrde was able to pick up the most pieces and guide his group to the top spot in the smuggling world. Known as an honest and honorable man, Karrde kept a low profile despite his lofty underworld position.\\n\\nIn 9 ABY, Karrde was drawn into the Galactic Civil War, in which he had previously avoided taking sides, when he rescued Luke Skywalker from being stranded in deep space and helped Skywalker avoid capture by Imperial leader Grand Admiral Thrawn, though only after his hand was forced. Thrawn placed a bounty on Karrde, driving him to sell the location of the Katana fleet, a secret he had kept since his days in Car'das's employ, to the New Republic. Karrde then organized the Smugglers' Alliance to represent the smugglers to the New Republic and aid in the battle against Thrawn. When Thrawn was defeated, Karrde remained a valued ally of Skywalker and the Solos but was not trusted by the New Republic leadership as a whole due to his shady past.\\n\\nIn 19 ABY, Karrde undertook a mission to find Car'das, whose retribution he had long feared, in order to seek out a copy of the Caamas Document and end the political crisis regarding it. Car'das did not have a copy, but did provide information that was key in exposing the hoax regarding Thrawn's return. In the aftermath of the peace treaty between the New Republic and Imperial Remnant, Karrde turned his organization into an information-sharing agency to maintain trust between the two governments. He lost his valued second-in-command, Mara Jade, in the process as she married Skywalker and took up the Jedi life. When the Yuuzhan Vong invaded six years later, Karrde revived the Smugglers' Alliance to combat the Yuuzhan Vong and played a key role, in partnership with Lando Calrissian and longtime friend Booster Terrik, in helping pro-Jedi Chief of State candidate Cal Omas be elected to office during the crisis. When the Jedi were declared enemies of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances in 40 ABY, Karrde put his organization at their disposal, having become a staunch ally of the Jedi in contrast to his previous desire for neutrality.\",\n",

When developing the 1977 film Star Wars, George Lucas cast Cushing in the role of Grand Moff Tarkin to provide a human counterpart for the primary villain, Darth Vader, although Cushing claimed he was approached for the role of the noble Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. Cushing accepted the role on the basis that he felt his fans would enjoy seeing him in a science fiction film. His part in the film was recorded over a two-week period in May 1976.\\n\\nThe boots created for Cushing's character were ill-suited for the size of his feet, leading the actor to ask Lucas to let him wear slippers and to shoot his scenes from the waist up. Cushing was a courteous but good-humored figure and became well-liked among the film's other cast members, with Carrie Fisher commenting that she found it difficult to act as though she hated his character. He admitted that he struggled with the level of technical jargon and special effects used in the film but worked hard to ensure that his character's dialogue sounded confident.\\n\\nGiven Cushing's well-known status, he was paid a higher salary than the film's lead actors—Fisher, Mark Hamill, and Harrison Ford—and promotional materials presented Tarkin as the main villain. Cushing enjoyed the film greatly and was proud of its success, describing his only disappointment as that his character's death meant that he could not reprise the role in the sequels. Cushing's involvement in Star Wars later influenced Lee's participation in the prequel trilogy films on account of their friendship. In the 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Cushing's likeness was recreated via motion capture over the performance of Guy Henry as Tarkin, with permission granted by Cushing's estate. His portrayal of Tarkin influenced the performances of several other actors in Star Wars projects, including Stephen Stanton, Richard E. Grant, and Giancarlo Esposito.\",\n",

Since there was little to hear on Baros other than howling winds, Brubbs were nearly deaf. Brubbs were strong for their size (1.5 to 1.7 meters tall), due to their origins on a high-gravity world. Brubbs also had the limited ability to camouflage themselves by changing skin color, though the color range was only from yellow to a greenish-gray.\\n\\n\\nBrubbs were a very social people, living in large communal groups called habas. Most habas were extended family groups which raised children communally and operated some specialized business together, such as a farm, a mine, or even a vacation resort. Certain \"university\" habas, however, were drawn from the best and brightest of many habas. These groups had technology approaching galactic standard, especially in the areas of solar and wind power. According to Obo Rin\\'s Catalog of Intelligent Life in the Galaxy, it was one of these university habas that first made contact with the outside galaxy, by beaming radio signals which eventually came to the attention of the Galactic Empire.

At the same time that the Brubbs were dealing with first contact with aliens, many female Brubbs were arguing for an equal share in haba leadership, and protesting by refusing to lay eggs.\\n\\n\\nSince Baros was a high-gravity world with few natural resources and low-tech natives, the Brubbs did not see much interstellar trade. Their main commodities were the Brubbs themselves—their strength and toughness made them prized mercenaries and laborers. Jabba the Hutt employed some Brubbs as guards on Khetanna, his sail barge.

A respected member of the Assembly of great Masters, Baas's time was divided between the Jedi epicenter on the world of Ossus and his academy for exceptional apprentices on the planet Dantooine. Although several of his students achieved fame for their efforts against the Sith, it was while under Baas's tutelage that a young Human named Exar Kun developed a fanatical desire for knowledge forbidden by the Jedi, and abandoned his Master's wisdom in search thereof.\\n\\nBy 3997 BBY, the influence of Sith magic had resurfaced and rapidly spread across the galaxy, headquartered in the Empress Teta system and propagated by the Krath cult. Vodo-Siosk Baas answered the summons of all Jedi to convene on the planet Deneba and discuss strategy against the new Sith, but while en route he experienced the despair of his errant apprentice's fall to the dark side and became even more concerned with the future safety of the galaxy. The Jedi Convocation was assailed by the Krath, an attack that spurred Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma into an infiltration mission of their ranks. Baas was among several Masters in meditation on Ossus who foresaw Qel-Droma's inevitable fall to the dark side, which culminated in his apprenticeship to the Dark Jedi Exar Kun, who had since become the Dark Lord of the Sith and had begun preparations for the restoration of a Sith Golden Age to the galaxy.\\n\\nWith the Lords of the Sith Brotherhood firmly enmeshed in total war against the Galactic Republic, Vodo-Siosk Baas represented the Masters of the Order on a diplomatic venture to the Galactic Senate on Coruscant with a request for permission to handle what they considered to be an internal affair.

He began his service in galactic affairs when he joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic following the destruction of his home planet. He succeeded Leia Organa as senator in the New Republic, and served in that position for several years, until Chief of State Borsk Fey'lya's last stand on Coruscant during the Yuuzhan Vong attack on the capital.\\n\\nOmas's peers in the Republic elected him as Fey'lya's successor, and although the New Republic would soon become the Galactic Alliance, the Alderaanian's leadership would see the end of the destructive Yuuzhan Vong War. However, peace was a rarity in the galaxy, and not more than five years later, trouble brewed in the Unknown Regions. The Dark Nest Crisis would not only pose problems to the Alliance externally, but would also create a rift between the government and the Jedi. Omas himself clashed, on several occasions, with Jedi such as Kyp Durron, Kenth Hamner, Jacen Solo, and even Luke Skywalker himself. Though the rift was eventually healed, the wound would be opened up again in due course.\\n\\nWhen the Alliance was faced with the threat of secession by the Corellians, Omas found himself accosted from all sides. Jacen Solo teamed up with Supreme Commander Cha Niathal, and began chipping away at Omas's government. The Chief of State could do little to retaliate, but when his opposite number in the Corellian government, Dur Gejjen, contacted him for peace talks, Omas saw an opportunity. However, his efforts to work with the Corellians to remove Niathal and Solo were disrupted by soldiers acting on Solo's orders. The upstart Solo then had Omas arrested, and he and Niathal replaced the Alderaaniaan as Joint Chiefs of State. To add insult to injury, Solo told young Ben Skywalker that Omas was responsible for the death of Mara Jade Skywalker (whom Solo himself had killed). Ben did not believe Solo, but he considered killing Omas to get near to Jacen, breaking into his prison cell. Before he could, however, Omas told Skywalker of Solo's duplicity, and then deliberately fell on Skywalker's saber, bringing the young man to the resolution he sought, and allowing him to regain the trust of Jacen Solo. He was survived by his daughter, Elya Omas.\",\n",

As an era, the New Sith Wars were characterized by a spectacular rise of the Sith, the decline of the Galactic Republic, and a growing militancy in the Jedi Order. The balance between the Sith and the Republic fluctuated during the period, and at several periods, especially after the pivotal Battle of Mizra, the Republic was in danger of being overwhelmed completely.\\n\\nCoinciding with the Draggulch Period of galactic history, the New Sith Wars were usually divided by historians into a series of shorter conflicts for convenience, such as the Sictis Wars.

The enactment of the proviso carried several limitations on non-Corellians within the sector, and also prevented the Republic from calling on the people of Corellia and the Corellian Security Force to contribute to the Republic Military. It was included in the Constitution in acknowledgment of Corellia's contributions toward founding the galactic government.\\n\\nThe clause was a proviso added in approximately 16,700 BBY and was so rarely invoked that it was considered obscure. One recorded instance was Corellia's attempted secession in 470 BBY. In a much later incident, Corellian Senator Garm Bel Iblis claimed Contemplanys Hermi during the Separatist Crisis so as to remove himself and his sector from the debate surrounding the Military Creation Act, which Bel Iblis believed would threaten Corellian sovereignty. Senator Bel Iblis was highly criticized for the move, but he maintained his stance against the Grand Army of the Republic throughout the Clone Wars and continued to neglect attending regular sessions of the Galactic Senate until compelled to do so during the Imperial Period.\",\n",

When the Galactic Empire rose to power in 19 BBY, Lemelisk was tasked by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin with the development of the Death Star battlestation, which would have the power to destroy entire worlds.\\n\\nThe Death Star's development and subsequent construction ensued for years, with Lemelisk working at the Maw Installation alongside designers including Frap Radicon and Umak Leth. When the station was finally completed, it was destroyed by the Alliance to Restore the Republic at the Battle of Yavin. Furious at the fact that the Alliance had been able to locate and exploit a fatal flaw in the design, Emperor Palpatine had Lemelisk executed, and subsequently resurrected in a clone body. Palpatine ordered Lemelisk to design a new Death Star, one that did not possess the same fatal flaw as the original. During development, the Emperor executed and resurrected Lemelisk a further six times.\\n\\nThough he succeeded in eliminating the original flaw, the Alliance once again destroyed his creation while it was under construction at Endor. Palpatine died his first death there, effectively allowing Lemelisk to avoid yet another execution. After a brief stint designing the Eclipse, news of Palpatine's return reached the architect, prompting him to flee. He found work in the employ of the Hutt crime lord Durga Besadii Tai, who tasked him with the creation of the Darksaber superweapon. Though his designs were more efficient than they had ever been, inferior workmanship and materials doomed Durga's weapon before it had even had a chance to be used. Per Lemelisk's predictions, the weapon failed and was destroyed, with Lemelisk himself captured by the New Republic. Four years later, he became one of the few people executed by the Republic for genocide.\",\n",

In the wake of widespread destruction caused by the Mass Shadow Generator, a superweapon used during the final battle of that conflict, Revan was inspired to seek more subtle methods of defeating his enemies. HK-47 was sent throughout the galaxy on his missions and successfully assassinated countless targets whom Revan had deemed threats to galactic stability and peace. However, HK-47 was badly crippled and captured on a mission in Mandalorian space shortly before Revan himself was captured by the Jedi Order.\\n\\nAs per protocol with Sith assassin droids prior to going on missions, HK-47's memory core was wiped of all knowledge of his original master. His memory could only be restored upon fulfilling his mission, and successfully returning to his master. As he never managed to return to his master, the automatic recall function was never activated, and he couldn't remember Revan. He went from owner to owner, many of whom he inadvertently slew personally. Eventually, he ended up on the planet Tatooine, where he was sold to and unwittingly reunited with Revan, whose memory had been erased following his capture. The droid went on to aid Revan after his return to the Jedi Order in his campaign to find and destroy the Star Forge, an ancient factory that Revan had used during his reign as the Dark Lord of the Sith. HK-47 was also instrumental in the defeat of Revan's former Sith apprentice, who had since begun utilizing the Star Forge in an attempt to conquer the Galactic Republic.\\n\\nHK-47 accompanied Revan to the edge of the Unknown Regions along with Revan's utility droid, T3-M4, before being left behind in Revan's starship, the Ebon Hawk, as the redeemed Jedi Knight journeyed on to face a threat he had remembered from his time as the Dark Lord. Sometime later, HK-47 was damaged and was left aboard the Ebon Hawk, which eventually ended up in the hands of one of Revan's allies from the Mandalorian Wars, Meetra Surik, also known as the Jedi Exile. During this period, HK-50 assassin droids, a newer version of HK that G0-T0 had mass-produced, became active in the galaxy, working as bounty hunters and saboteurs. Surik repaired HK-47, who recognized her as his new master and accompanied her in order to find the source of the HK-50s, whose very existence he considered an insult to himself. HK-47 also aided Surik in her search for the Jedi Masters who survived the First Jedi Purge and even advised her on techniques to more efficiently kill Jedi so that Surik could better defend herself.\\n\\nHK-47 eventually succeeded in finding the HK Manufacturing Plant, where the HK-50s were created. There, he convinced the HK-50s to join his and Surik's cause. This action eventually culminated in a final confrontation on Malachor V between HK-47, assisted by the HK-50s, and G0-T0, whose interests conflicted with that of Surik, and the latter droid was destroyed. After his time with Surik, HK-47 set out on his own to attempt to find Revan, his original master, not knowing that Revan had since been captured by the Sith Empire and was being held in stasis. Three hundred years later, HK-47 was found by a returned Revan and aided him in commanding the Rakatan Foundry, and though he was destroyed, the rogue intelligence operative known as the Shroud copied the droid and saw to it that several versions of HK-47 were active over the following years with different masters.\\n\\nFour millennia later, HK-47 was found on the planet Mustafar, where his memory core was preserved within the computer of a derelict starship.

Thus the species attacked with ferocity, their invasion stalling only once the fleet, under command of Warmaster Tsavong Lah, had overextended itself. A vendetta against Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order, a heretical movement brewing among the lower castes, and rumors that their long-destroyed homeworld haunted the Unknown Regions were only a few of the factors which caused the stagnation of the Yuuzhan Vong empire. After their swift advance, technological parity soon emerged between the New Republic and the Yuuzhan Vong. The Mandalorians, led by Boba Fett, joined the Yuuzhan Vong empire in its quest to conquer the galaxy; this, however, was a ruse, and the Mandalorians were actually double agents, later joining the rest of the forces defending the galaxy. Once the New Republic had recovered from the loss of its capital, the Yuuzhan Vong were dealt a disastrous defeat at Ebaq 9.\\n\\nWracked with internal tensions as it was, the Yuuzhan Vong Empire was still able to neutralize many of the threats facing it, including the Yevetha and the Ssi-ruuk, before going once more on the offensive. The New Republic, which was reformed under Alderaanian Chief of State Cal Omas into the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, was brought to the brink of defeat, and moved toward the fatal deployment of Alpha Red, a pathogen hostile to the Yuuzhan Vong, in response to a renewed Yuuzhan Vong advance upon its temporary capital at Dac. This dangerous end to the war was averted when Zonama Sekot, a seed of the lost living homeworld of the Yuuzhan Vong, emerged over Coruscant, its arrival precipitating the final battle of the conflict. Skywalker and other leading Jedi, who had located Zonama Sekot and urged its return, defeated Shimrra Jamaane and the true master of the Yuuzhan Vong, Onimi, during the battle, while fleets of warships clashed once more in space. The Yuuzhan Vong War ended with the deaths of the Supreme Overlord and the surrender of Warmaster Nas Choka's armada. The resulting Sekot Accords, which stipulated disarmament and amnesty for the Yuuzhan Vong, proved deeply unpopular for many; both the Yuuzhan Vong, and the aftermath of their devastating war, played a major role in events to come.\",\n",
