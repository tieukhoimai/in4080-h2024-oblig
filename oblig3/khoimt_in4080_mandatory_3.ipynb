    "Mandatory assignment 3 is about the practical use of Large Language Models (LLMs). More specifically, you will be tasked to implement a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system able to answer factual questions based on a document database, more specifically Wiki pages extracted from an [online Star Wars encyclopedia](https://starwars.fandom.com). \n",

We want to stress that simply submitting code is __not__ by itself sufficient to complete the assignment - we expect the notebook to also contain explanations of what you have implemented, along with motivations for the choices you made along the way. Preferably use whole sentences, and mathematical formulas if necessary. Explaining in your own words (using concepts we have covered through in the lectures) what you have implemented and reflecting on your solution is an important part of the learning process - take it seriously!\n",

      "- Niima Outpost was a junkyard settlement on Jakku, a desert planet in the Western Reaches of the galaxy. The outpost was named for and founded by Niima the Hutt after the Battle of Jakku to capitalize on the new scavenging opportunities the battle created on the planet. Niima Outpost was the only spaceport on the planet, although it was referred more as a landing field rather than a spaceport.Rey's Survival Guide Scavengers, like Rey, salvaged materials from the technology leftover from the Battle of Jakku. Salvage made up the backbone of the economy, but other branches such as black market trading, mercenaries for hire, and other unlawful activities exist.  Niima's fuel supplies were basic, though there were some scavengers who located military grade supplies, such as rhydonium. Niima attracted a lot of attention offworld because of it being the only navigational beacon on the planet. These foreigners were encouraged to lock up their ships. Most travelers opted to sleep on their ships due to lack of permanent structures in the outpost. Scavengers brought their finds to Niima Outpost in exchange for supplies from Unkar Plutt, the local boss who operated from the center of awning-roofed blockhouse known as the Concession Stand. Niima Outpost was also the location of Constable Zuvio's office. The outpost's main gate utilized architecture akin to that found on other Hutt worlds such as Teth. Sarco Plank opened a gun shop at the outpost to modify and enhance blasters.  The outpost was attacked by the First Order, who were looking for the astromech droid BB-8 and stormtrooper defector Finn.\n",
      "- The Office of the Constable was a small building used as a headquarters by the Niima Outpost Militia on Jakku.\n",
      "- Niima, also known as Niima the Hutt, was an enterprising female Hutt scoundrel who operated far from the borders of Hutt Space, a province of the galaxy that became embroiled in conflict as the Hutts attempted to carve up the deceased crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure's territory. Niima resided in a temple on the desert planet of Jakku. Prior to the Battle of Jakku, Niima struck a deal with Gallius Rax, the Counselor to the Empire, to guard the pass to the Plaintive Hand plateau and kidnap local orphans in return for receiving weapons. Later, Rae Sloane struck a deal with Niima to gain access to the Jakku Observatory, claiming that it hid a powerful weapon there.  Niima was later wounded when Rax ambushed her convoy and captured Sloane and Brentin Lore Wexley. Despite being wounded, Niima survived with the help of the bounty hunter Jas Emari, who ferried her back to her temple. Following the Battle of Jakku, Niima monopolized the salvage collection efforts on Jakku and established Niima Outpost. Though Niima was later killed by a bounty hunter, Niima Outpost continued to bear her name. It was rumored that a group who worshiped the Hutts as gods constructed their village around the cranial mantle of Niima herself, gilded in precious metals and covered with jewels, following her demise.\n",

      "- Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber, also known as Luke Skywalker's lightsaber or Luke Skywalker's second lightsaber, was a Jedi lightsaber constructed by Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker during the Galactic Civil War. It was modeled on the third lightsaber of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, though its kyber crystal emitted a green plasma blade unlike the blue produced by Kenobi's.  Skywalker constructed his own lightsaber after losing his father's in a duel with the Sith Lord Darth Vader. He used it to kill Jabba Desilijic Tiure's bodyguards while rescuing Han Solo on Tatooine. In the Battle of Endor, Vader lost his lightsaber as a result of his defeat by Skywalker during their final lightsaber duel.  In the aftermath of the Galactic Civil War, Skywalker retained his lightsaber while endeavoring to restore the Jedi Order. When he sensed the dark side of the Force rising in his nephew, Padawan Ben Solo, he instinctively activated his lightsaber but restrained himself from killing his apprentice. However, Solo was convinced that his Master intended to kill him upon seeing the green blade of Skywalker's lightsaber, and used his own lightsaber in an attempt to strike down Skywalker first.  Having lost his nephew to the dark side, along with his remaining students, who were killed in the destruction of his Jedi temple, Skywalker brought his lightsaber to the planet Ahch-To where he lived in self-imposed exile and isolation. After his death, the native Caretakers took possession of Skywalker's lightsaber.\n",

      "- Niima Outpost was a junkyard settlement on Jakku, a desert planet in the Western Reaches of the galaxy. The outpost was named for and founded by Niima the Hutt after the Battle of Jakku to capitalize on the new scavenging opportunities the battle created on the planet. Niima Outpost was the only spaceport on the planet, although it was referred more as a landing field rather than a spaceport.Rey's Survival Guide Scavengers, like Rey, salvaged materials from the technology leftover from the Battle of Jakku. Salvage made up the backbone of the economy, but other branches such as black market trading, mercenaries for hire, and other unlawful activities exist.  Niima's fuel supplies were basic, though there were some scavengers who located military grade supplies, such as rhydonium. Niima attracted a lot of attention offworld because of it being the only navigational beacon on the planet. These foreigners were encouraged to lock up their ships. Most travelers opted to sleep on their ships due to lack of permanent structures in the outpost. Scavengers brought their finds to Niima Outpost in exchange for supplies from Unkar Plutt, the local boss who operated from the center of awning-roofed blockhouse known as the Concession Stand. Niima Outpost was also the location of Constable Zuvio's office. The outpost's main gate utilized architecture akin to that found on other Hutt worlds such as Teth. Sarco Plank opened a gun shop at the outpost to modify and enhance blasters.  The outpost was attacked by the First Order, who were looking for the astromech droid BB-8 and stormtrooper defector Finn.\n",
      "- Niima, also known as Niima the Hutt, was an enterprising female Hutt scoundrel who operated far from the borders of Hutt Space, a province of the galaxy that became embroiled in conflict as the Hutts attempted to carve up the deceased crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure's territory. Niima resided in a temple on the desert planet of Jakku. Prior to the Battle of Jakku, Niima struck a deal with Gallius Rax, the Counselor to the Empire, to guard the pass to the Plaintive Hand plateau and kidnap local orphans in return for receiving weapons. Later, Rae Sloane struck a deal with Niima to gain access to the Jakku Observatory, claiming that it hid a powerful weapon there.  Niima was later wounded when Rax ambushed her convoy and captured Sloane and Brentin Lore Wexley. Despite being wounded, Niima survived with the help of the bounty hunter Jas Emari, who ferried her back to her temple. Following the Battle of Jakku, Niima monopolized the salvage collection efforts on Jakku and established Niima Outpost. Though Niima was later killed by a bounty hunter, Niima Outpost continued to bear her name. It was rumored that a group who worshiped the Hutts as gods constructed their village around the cranial mantle of Niima herself, gilded in precious metals and covered with jewels, following her demise.\n",
